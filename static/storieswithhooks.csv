"A car with fishhooks attached to the front sped up onto the sidewalk. A girl wearing a mask stood in its path, too scared to move. I acted quickly, grabbing her elbow and pulling her out of the way just in time. The car zoomed past, leaving a cloud of smoke behind, and tore a piece of her skirt.

“Did the hooks get you?” I asked her.

She looked at her skirt. “No, I’m okay,” she said, sounding shaky.

The car that nearly hit her was gone, and people around us were talking about how dangerous these kids were. Two police officers on motorcycles chased after the car, but it had left a thick cloud of smoke, making it hard to see.

“Are you from England?” the girl asked me, her voice trembling from behind her mask.

“Yes, I am,” I answered. Then, out of nowhere, she asked, “Can you come to my place tonight? I need to thank you and ask for your help with something.”

She gave me her address, and I agreed to meet her later.

A police officer came over to check my papers and asked how long I’d be in New York. I told him just for a week. He mentioned I might need to stay longer if they needed me as a witness.

“They tried to hurt her,” I said, pointing out the car had aimed for the girl.

“They don’t usually try to kill anyone. They just like ripping skirts,” the officer explained.

The girl had already disappeared by then, leaving me wondering what she was really scared of.

Later that evening, I went to the address the girl had given me. It was in a dangerous part of town, near a place called Inferno. Her apartment was nicely furnished, with a TV playing a masked woman singing. When the girl appeared, she was wearing a gray fur coat and a gray mask. She seemed nervous.

“We can’t talk here,” she said, leading me to a waiting cab outside.

In the cab, I tried asking her why those people in the car wanted to hurt her, but she seemed distracted, talking about the moon instead. The TV in the cab was showing a wrestling match between a man and a woman, which made me uncomfortable. I asked the driver to turn it off, but the girl stopped me, looking scared.

Eventually, we arrived at a place she called “Heaven,” though it wasn’t as nice as it sounded. Inside the club, it was dark, with music playing loudly. We ordered some food and drinks, and I tried to find out what was bothering her.

“I need to get out of the country,” she whispered. “Can you help me get to England?”

I was surprised but said I could help. As we talked, three men from earlier approached us. They looked like trouble, but a man named Zirk showed up and scared them off. He was someone important, and the girl seemed to know him.

Zirk sat with us, and I realized he had some control over her. When I tried to get her to leave with me, she didn’t move. Zirk started acting possessive, and I got angry, telling him to stop. I even punched him when he wouldn’t leave her alone. But to my shock, the girl defended him, using her sharp, metal-tipped fingernails to scratch my face.

I pulled off her mask, expecting to see something different. But her face wasn’t what I imagined. It was pale, and she looked scared—but there was something else there too, something unsettling.

Disgusted and confused, I walked away, holding my bleeding cheek. I wished I could leave New York and go back to England, far away from all this.
