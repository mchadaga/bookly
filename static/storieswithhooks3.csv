000.txt,"### Coming Attraction

Women will always try to get the attention of men, even if the future looks bleak.

A car with spikes on its fender jumped the curb like something out of a nightmare. The girl in its path froze, probably scared stiff under her mask. For once, I was quick to react. I stepped toward her, grabbed her elbow, and pulled her back. Her black skirt flew out as she moved.

The big car zoomed by with a hum. I saw three faces inside. Something tore. I felt the hot exhaust on my ankles as the car swerved back onto the street. A black cloud puffed out from its rear, and a shimmering black rag tore away from one of the spikes.

“Did they get you?” I asked the girl.

She turned to look at the tear in her skirt. She was wearing nylon tights.

“The hooks didn’t touch me,” she said, still shaky. “I guess I’m lucky.”

I heard people talking around us:

“Those kids! What’ll they do next?”

“They’re dangerous. They should be arrested.”

Sirens wailed as two police officers on motorcycles sped toward us, chasing the car. But the black cloud had become a thick fog, blocking the whole street. The officers switched from speeding to stopping and skidded to a halt near the smoke.

“Are you English?” the girl asked me. “You have an English accent.”

Her voice was still shaky behind her sleek black satin mask. I imagined her teeth chattering. Her eyes, maybe blue, looked at me through the mask’s eyeholes. I told her she was right. She stood close to me. “Will you come to my place tonight?” she asked quickly. “I can’t thank you now. And there’s something you can help me with.”

My arm was still lightly around her waist, feeling her tremble. I was answering her silent plea as much as her words when I said, “Sure.” She gave me an address south of Inferno, an apartment number, and a time. She asked my name, and I told her.

“Hey, you!”

I turned to a policeman’s shout. He waved away the small crowd of masked women and barefaced men. Coughing from the smoke the car left, he asked for my papers. I handed him the important ones.

He looked them over. “British Barter? How long will you be in New York?”

I held back the urge to say, “For as short a time as possible,” and told him I’d be there for a week or so.

“May need you as a witness,” he explained. “Those kids can’t use smoke on us. When they do, we pull them in.”

He seemed to think the smoke was the bad part. “They tried to hurt the lady,” I pointed out.

He shook his head wisely. “They always act like they will, but really they just want to snag skirts. I’ve seen rooms full of skirt rips tacked up. Of course, sometimes they get too close.”

I explained that if I hadn’t pulled her away, she’d have been hit by more than hooks. But he interrupted, “If she thought it was a real murder attempt, she’d have stayed here.”

I looked around. It was true. She was gone.

“She was really scared,” I told him.

“Who wouldn’t be? Those kids would’ve scared even Stalin.”

“I mean she was scared of more than just ‘kids.’ They didn’t look like ‘kids.’”

“What did they look like?”

I tried to describe the three faces but didn’t succeed. A vague impression of meanness and looking fancy doesn’t say much.

“Well, I could be wrong,” he said finally. “Do you know the girl? Where she lives?”

“No,” I half lied.

The other policeman finished his radio call and walked toward us, kicking at the smoke. The black cloud no longer hid the building fronts with their five-year-old burn marks, and I could see the broken Empire State Building rising from Inferno like a mangled finger.

“They haven’t been caught yet,” the other policeman grumbled. “Left smoke for five blocks, from what they say.”

The first policeman shook his head. “That’s bad,” he said seriously.

I felt uneasy and ashamed. An Englishman shouldn’t lie, at least not on impulse.

“They sound like trouble,” the first policeman continued in the same serious tone. “We’ll need witnesses. Looks like you might have to stay in New York longer than you expect.”

I got the point. I said, “I forgot to show you all my papers,” and handed him a few others, slipping a five-dollar bill in between them.

When he handed them back, his voice wasn’t as ominous. My guilt vanished. To strengthen our connection, I chatted with the two of them about their job.

“I suppose the masks cause some trouble,” I said. “In England, we’ve heard about your masked female bandits.”

“Those stories are exaggerated,” the first policeman assured me. “It’s the men dressing as women that really confuse us. But when we catch them, we don’t hold back.”

“And you get so you can spot women almost as if they didn’t have masks,” the second policeman added. “You know, by their hands and all that.”

“Especially all that,” the first agreed with a chuckle. “Is it true some girls don’t wear masks in England?”

“A number have picked up the fashion,” I told him. “Only a few, though—the ones who always adopt the latest style, however extreme.”

“They’re usually masked in the British news.”

“I imagine it’s arranged that way out of respect for American taste,” I confessed. “Actually, not many do mask.”

The second policeman considered that. “Girls going down the street bare from the neck up.” It wasn’t clear if he liked the idea or found it distasteful. Likely both.

“A few members keep trying to get Parliament to make a law against all masking,” I continued, maybe talking too much.

The second policeman shook his head. “What an idea. You know, masks are a good thing. In a couple of years, I’ll make my wife wear hers around the house.”

The first policeman shrugged. “If women stopped wearing masks, in six weeks you wouldn’t know the difference. You get used to anything if enough people do it.”

I agreed, a bit sadly, and left them. I turned north on Broadway and walked quickly until I was past Inferno. Passing such a radioactive area always makes a person uneasy. I thanked God there weren’t any in England, yet.

The street was almost empty, though a couple of beggars with faces scarred by H-bombs, whether real or fake, approached me. A fat woman held out a baby with webbed fingers and toes. I told myself it would’ve been deformed anyway and she was just using our fear of bomb mutations. Still, I gave her some change. Her mask made me feel like I was paying tribute to an African idol.

“May all your children have one head and two eyes, sir.”

“Thanks,” I said, shuddering, and hurried past her.

“... There's only trash behind the mask, so turn your head, stick to your task: Stay away, stay away—from—the—girls!”

This last was the end of a song being sung by some religious folks half a block from a femalist temple. They reminded me only faintly of our small British monastics. Above them was a jumble of billboards advertising foods, wrestling lessons, and radio gadgets.

I stared at the exaggerated slogans with distaste. Since female faces and forms have been banned from American ads, the very letters have become suggestive—the curvy, big-bellied B, the suggestive double O. However, it’s mainly the mask that makes sex so prominent in America.

A British anthropologist noted that, while it took 5,000 years to shift the main point of sexual interest from hips to breasts, the next transition to the face took less than 50 years. Comparing the American style with Muslim tradition isn’t valid; Muslim women are forced to wear veils, which are meant to hide, while American women follow fashion to create mystery.

Theory aside, the trend came from the anti-radiation clothing of World War III, which led to masked wrestling, now a hugely popular sport, and that led to the current female fashion. Initially wild, masks quickly became as necessary as bras and lipsticks had been earlier.

I realized I wasn’t thinking about masks in general, but about what was behind one in particular. That’s the trouble with them; you’re never sure if a girl is hiding or enhancing her beauty. I pictured a cool, pretty face with fear showing only in her eyes. Then I remembered her blonde hair against the black satin mask. She’d told me to come at ten p.m.

I climbed to my apartment near the British Consulate; the elevator shaft had been knocked off balance by an old blast, a nuisance in these tall New York buildings. Before I realized I’d be going out again, I automatically tore a tab from the film strip under my shirt. I developed it just to be sure. It showed that the total radiation I’d taken that day was still within the safety limit. I’m not overly worried about it, as many people are these days, but there’s no point in taking chances.

I flopped down on the day bed and stared at the silent speaker and dark screen of the video set. As always, they made me think, somewhat bitterly, of the two great nations of the world. Damaged by each other, yet still strong, they were crippled giants poisoning the planet with dreams of impossible equality and success.

I switched on the speaker. By luck, the newscaster was talking excitedly about a great wheat crop, sown by planes across a dried-out land moistened by rains. I listened carefully to the rest of the program (it was remarkably free of Russian interference) but there was no more news of interest to me. And, of course, no mention of the Moon, though everyone knows that America and Russia are racing to turn their bases into fortresses capable of attacking each other and launching bombs toward Earth. I knew very well that the British electronic equipment I was helping trade for American wheat was meant for spaceships.

I switched off the newscast. It was getting dark and again I pictured a tender, frightened face behind a mask. I hadn’t had a date since England. It’s very hard to meet a girl in America, where even a smile can make one of them call the police—to say nothing of the growing strictness and the gangs that keep most women indoors after dark. And naturally, the masks which are definitely not, as the Soviets claim, a last invention of capitalist degeneracy, but a sign of great psychological insecurity. The Russians have no masks, but they have their own signs of stress.

I went to the window and impatiently watched the darkness gather. I was getting very restless. After a while, a ghostly violet cloud appeared to the south. My hair stood on end. Then I laughed. I had briefly thought it was radiation from the Hell-bomb crater, though I should have known it was only the radio-induced glow in the sky over the amusement area south of Inferno.

At ten p.m. I stood before the door of my unknown girlfriend’s apartment. The electronic say-who-please said just that. I answered clearly, “Wysten Turner,” wondering if she’d given my name to the mechanism. She evidently had, for the door opened. I walked into a small empty living room, my heart pounding a bit.

The room was nicely furnished with the latest chairs and sofas. There were some books on the table. The one I picked up was a detective story where two female killers were after each other.

The TV was on. A masked girl in green was singing a love song. Her right hand held something that blurred off into the foreground. I saw the set had a handie, which we don’t have in England yet, and curiously slipped my hand into the opening beside the screen. It wasn’t like slipping into a rubber glove, but as if the girl on the screen actually held my hand.

A door opened behind me. I quickly pulled my hand out as if I’d been caught spying.

She stood in the bedroom doorway. I think she was trembling. She was wearing a gray fur coat, white-speckled, and a gray velvet evening mask with lace around the eyes and mouth. Her nails twinkled like silver.

It hadn’t occurred to me that she’d expect us to go out.

“I should have told you,” she said softly. Her mask glanced nervously at the books and the screen and the room’s dark corners. “But I can’t possibly talk to you here.”

I said doubtfully, “There’s a place near the Consulate....”

“I know where we can be together and talk,” she said quickly. “If you don’t mind.”

As we entered the elevator I said, “I’m afraid I dismissed the cab.”

But the cab driver hadn’t gone for some reason of his own. He jumped out and held the front door open for us, smirking. I told him we preferred to sit in back. He sulkily opened the rear door, slammed it after us, and jumped in front, slamming the door behind him.

My companion leaned forward. “Heaven,” she said.

The driver switched on the turbine and televisor.

“Why did you ask if I were a British subject?” I said, to start the conversation.

She leaned away from me, tilting her mask close to the window. “Look at the Moon,” she said dreamily.

“But why, really?” I pressed, feeling a bit annoyed.

“It’s edging up into the purple of the sky.”

“What’s your name?”

“The purple makes it look yellower.”

Just then I realized what was irritating me. It was the square of light in the front of the cab beside the driver.

I don’t mind ordinary wrestling matches, though they bore me, but I can’t stand watching a man wrestle a woman. The fact that the matches are generally “real,” with the man at a disadvantage in weight and reach and the masked females young and pretty, only makes them seem worse to me.

“Please turn off the screen,” I asked the driver.

He shook his head without looking around. “No way, man,” he said. “They’ve been prepping that babe for weeks for this match with Little Zirk.”

Infuriated, I reached forward, but my companion caught my arm. “Please,” she whispered, shaking her head.

I settled back, frustrated. She was closer to me now, but silent and for a few moments I watched the heaves and contortions of the powerful masked girl and her wiry masked opponent on the screen. His frantic scrambling at her reminded me of a male spider.

I turned to my companion. “Why did those three men want to kill you?” I asked sharply.

The eyeholes of her mask faced the screen. “Because they’re jealous of me,” she whispered.

“Why are they jealous?”

She still didn’t look at me. “Because of him.”

“Who?”

She didn’t answer.

I put my arm around her shoulders. “Are you afraid to tell me?” I asked. “What is the matter?”

She still didn’t look my way. She smelled nice.

“See here,” I said laughingly, changing my tactics, “you really should tell me something about yourself. I don’t even know what you look like.”

I half playfully lifted my hand to the band of her neck. She gave it a swift slap. I pulled it away in sudden pain. There were four tiny indentations on the back. From one of them a tiny bead of blood welled out as I watched. I looked at her silver fingernails and saw they were actually delicate and pointed metal caps.

“I’m dreadfully sorry,” I heard her say, “but you frightened me. I thought for a moment you were going to...”

At last she turned to me. Her coat had fallen open. Her evening dress was Cretan Revival, a bodice of lace beneath and supporting the breasts without covering them.

“Don’t be angry,” she said, putting her arms around my neck. “You were wonderful this afternoon.”

The soft gray velvet of her mask, molding itself to her cheek, pressed mine. Through the mask’s lace, the wet warm tip of her tongue touched my chin.

“I’m not angry,” I said. “Just puzzled and anxious to help.”

The cab stopped. To either side were black windows bordered by spears of broken glass. The sickly purple light showed a few ragged figures slowly moving toward us.

The driver muttered, “It’s the turbine, man. We’re grounded.” He sat there hunched and motionless. “Wish it had happened somewhere else.”

My companion whispered, “Five dollars is the usual amount.”

She looked out so shudderingly at the congregating figures that I suppressed my indignation and did as she suggested. The driver took the bill without a word. As he started up, he put his hand out the window and I heard a few coins clink on the pavement.

My companion came back into my arms, but her mask faced the television screen, where the tall girl had just pinned the convulsively kicking Little Zirk.

“I’m so frightened,” she breathed.

Heaven turned out to be an equally ruinous neighborhood, but it had a club with an awning and a huge doorman uniformed like a spaceman, but in gaudy colors. In my sensuous daze I rather liked it all. We stepped out of the cab just as a drunken old woman came down the sidewalk, her mask awry. A couple ahead of us turned their heads from the half-revealed face, as if from an ugly body at the beach. As we followed them in I heard the doorman say, “Get along, grandma, and watch yourself.”

Inside, everything was dimness and blue glows. She had said we could talk here, but I didn’t see how. Besides the inevitable chorus of sneezes and coughs (they say America is fifty percent allergic these days), there was a band going full blast in the latest robop style, in which an electronic composing machine selects an arbitrary sequence of tones into which the musicians weave their raucous little individualities.

Most of the people were in booths. The band was behind the bar. On a small platform beside them, a girl was dancing, stripped to her mask. The little cluster of men at the shadowy far end of the bar weren’t looking at her.

We inspected the menu in gold script on the wall and pushed the buttons for breast of chicken, fried shrimps, and two scotches. Moments later, the serving bell tinkled. I opened the gleaming panel and took out our drinks.

The cluster of men at the bar filed off toward the door, but first they glanced around the room. My companion threw back her coat. Their look lingered on our booth. I noticed that there were three of them.

The band chased off the dancing girl with growls. I handed my companion a straw and we sipped our drinks.

“You wanted me to help you with something,” I said. “Incidentally, I think you’re lovely.”

She nodded quick thanks, looked around, leaned forward. “Would it be hard for me to get to England?”

“No,” I replied, a bit taken aback. “Provided you have an American passport.”

“Are they difficult to get?”

“Rather,” I said, surprised at her lack of information. “Your country doesn’t like its nationals to travel, though it isn’t quite as strict as Russia.”

“Could the British Consulate help me get a passport?”

“It’s hardly their...”

“Could you?”

I realized we were being watched. A man and two girls had paused opposite our table. The girls were tall and wolfish-looking, with spangled masks. The man stood jauntily between them like a fox on its hind legs.

My companion didn’t glance at them, but she sat back. I noticed that one of the girls had a big yellow bruise on her forearm. After a moment they walked to a booth in the deep shadows.

“Know them?” I asked. She didn’t reply. I finished my drink. “I’m not sure you’d like England,” I said. “The austerity’s altogether different from your American brand of misery.”

She leaned forward again. “But I must get away,” she whispered.

“Why?” I was getting impatient.

“Because I’m so frightened.”

There were chimes. I opened the panel and handed her the fried shrimps. The sauce on my breast of chicken was a delicious steaming compound of almonds, soy, and ginger. But something must have been wrong with the oven that had thawed and heated it, for at the first bite I crunched a kernel of ice in the meat. These delicate mechanisms need constant repair and there aren’t enough mechanics.

I put down my fork. “What are you really scared of?” I asked her.

For once her mask didn’t turn away from my face. As I waited I could feel the fears gathering without her naming them, tiny dark shapes swarming through the curved night outside, converging on the radioactive pest spot of New York, dipping into the margins of the purple. I felt a sudden rush of sympathy, a desire to protect the girl opposite me. The warm feeling added itself to the infatuation I felt in the cab.

“Everything,” she said finally.

I nodded and touched her hand.

“I’m afraid of the Moon,” she began, her voice going dreamy and brittle as it had in the cab. “You can’t look at it and not think of guided bombs.”

“It’s the same Moon over England,” I reminded her.

“But it’s not England’s Moon anymore. It’s ours and Russia’s. You’re not responsible.”

I pressed her hand.

“Oh, and then,” she said with a tilt of her mask, “I’m afraid of the cars and the gangs and the loneliness and Inferno. I’m afraid of the lust that undresses your face. And—” her voice hushed—“I’m afraid of the wrestlers.”

“Yes?” I prompted softly after a moment.

Her mask came forward. “Do you know something about the wrestlers?” she asked rapidly. “The ones that wrestle women, I mean. They often lose, you know. And then they have to have a girl to take their frustration out on. A girl who’s soft and weak and terribly frightened. They need that, to keep them men. Other men don’t want them to have a girl. Other men want them just to fight women and be heroes. But they must have a girl. It’s horrible for her.”

I squeezed her fingers tighter, as if courage could be transmitted—granting I had any. “I think I can get you to England,” I said.

Shadows crawled onto the table and stayed there. I looked up at the three men who had been at the end of the bar. They were the men I had seen in the big car. They wore black sweaters and tight black trousers. Their faces were as blank as dopers’. Two of them stood above me. The other loomed over the girl.

“Drift off, man,” I was told. I heard the other inform the girl: “We’ll wrestle a fall, sister. What shall it be? Judo, slapsie or kill-who-can?”

I stood up. There are times when an Englishman simply must be mistreated. But just then the fox-like man came gliding in like the star of a ballet. The reaction of the other three startled me. They were acutely embarrassed.

He smiled at them thinly. “You won’t win my favor by tricks like this,” he said.

“Don’t get the wrong idea, Zirk,” one of them pleaded.

“I will if it’s right,” he said. “She told me what you tried to do this afternoon. That won’t endear you to me, either. Drift.”

They backed off awkwardly. “Let’s get out of here,” one of them said loudly as they turned. “I know a place where they fight naked with knives.”

Little Zirk laughed musically and slipped into the seat beside my companion. She shrank from him, just a little. I pushed my feet back, leaned forward.

“Who’s your friend, baby?” he asked, not looking at her.

She passed the question to me with a little gesture. I told him.

“British,” he observed. “She’s been asking you about getting out of the country? About passports?” He smiled pleasantly. “She likes to start running away. Don’t you, baby?” His small hand began to stroke her wrist, the fingers bent a little, the tendons ridged, as if he were about to grab and twist.

“Look here,” I said sharply. “I have to be grateful to you for ordering off those bullies, but—”

“Think nothing of it,” he told me. “They’re no harm except when they’re behind steering wheels. A well-trained fourteen-year-old girl could cripple any one of them. Why, even Theda here, if she went in for that sort of thing...” He turned to her, shifting his hand from her wrist to her hair. He stroked it, letting the strands slip slowly through his fingers. “You know I lost tonight, baby, don’t you?” he said softly.

I stood up. “Come along,” I said to her. “Let’s leave.”

She just sat there. I couldn’t even tell if she was trembling. I tried to read a message in her eyes through the mask.

“I’ll take you away,” I said to her. “I can do it. I really will.”

He smiled at me. “She’d like to go with you,” he said. “Wouldn’t you, baby?”

“Will you or won’t you?” I said to her. She still just sat there.

He slowly knotted his fingers in her hair.

“Listen, you little vermin,” I snapped at him, “take your hands off her.”

He came up from the seat like a snake. I’m no fighter. I just know that the more scared I am, the harder and straighter I hit. This time I was lucky. But as he crumpled back, I felt a slap and four stabs of pain in my cheek. I clapped my hand to it. I could feel the four gashes made by her dagger finger caps, and the warm blood oozing out from them.

She didn’t look at me. She was bending over Little Zirk and cuddling her mask to his cheek and crooning: “There, there, don’t feel bad, you’ll be able to hurt me afterward.”

There were sounds around us, but they didn’t come close. I leaned forward and ripped the mask from her face.

I really don’t know why I should have expected her face to be anything else. It was very pale, of course, and there weren’t any cosmetics. I suppose there’s no point in wearing any under a mask. The eyebrows were untidy and the lips chapped. But as for the general expression, as for the feelings crawling and wriggling across it—

Have you ever lifted a rock from damp soil? Have you ever watched the slimy white grubs?

I looked down at her, she up at me. “Yes, you’re so frightened, aren’t you?” I said sarcastically. “You dread this little nightly drama, don’t you? You’re scared to death.”

And I walked right out into the purple night, still holding my hand to my bleeding cheek. No one stopped me, not even the girl wrestlers. I wished I could tear a tab from under my shirt and test it then and there, and find I’d taken too much radiation, and so be able to ask to cross the Hudson and go down New Jersey, past the lingering radiance of the Narrows Bomb, and so on to Sandy Hook to wait for the rusty ship that would take me back over the seas to England.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""Coming Attraction"" revolves around the pervasive insecurity and dehumanization in a dystopian future society, as experienced through the interactions between the protagonist, Wysten Turner, and the masked girl he rescues. This conflict is multifaceted, involving both societal and personal dilemmas:

1. **Societal Conflict**: The story is set in a post-apocalyptic America, where societal norms have become distorted due to the aftermath of wars and the pervasive threat of violence. Women wear masks as part of a disturbing fashion trend that both protects and objectifies them, contributing to a culture where genuine human connection and trust are elusive. The masked wrestling matches, with men often pitted against women, symbolize the broader societal conflict of aggression and dehumanization.

2. **Personal Conflict**: On a personal level, Wysten Turner is caught between his desire to help the girl and his growing disillusionment with the society he finds himself in. The girl's fear and the mysterious circumstances surrounding her life pull him into a web of intrigue and danger. His interactions with her reveal his struggle to understand and navigate a world where appearances are deceptive and motivations are unclear. The girl herself embodies this conflict, as she initially appears to be a damsel in distress, only to reveal a more complex and complicit nature.

3. **Emotional Dilemma**: The protagonist's emotional journey is marked by his initial infatuation and desire to protect the girl, which gradually turns into a realization of her complicity in the societal games of manipulation and violence. This culminates in a moment of betrayal when she attacks him, forcing him to confront the reality behind the mask—both literally and figuratively.

Overall, the central conflict is a commentary on the alienation and moral decay in a future world shaped by war and fear, reflected in the personal interactions between individuals who are unable to truly connect or trust one another.","Imagine a world where everyone wears masks—not to hide, but to deceive. Can you trust anyone?",What if your act of bravery leads you into a web of lies and danger? Would you still be brave?,"If saving someone dragged you into a world of masked intentions, would you still be the hero?"
001.txt,"George H. Cutter drove his big car into his reserved spot with style. The bright California sun shone down on him as he walked toward the square, four-story brick building with ""Cutter Products, Inc."" over the door. A big truck was backing up to the loading dock, and the driver was craning his neck to see. Cutter, a strong man though not very tall, moved quickly forward. His eyes sparkled as he watched Kurt, the truck driver, skillfully fit the truck's rear end into the tight space.

""Get that junk out of the way!"" Cutter shouted, his voice booming over the truck's engine noise.

Kurt turned his head, his blue eyes narrowing, but then he recognized Cutter and smiled. ""All right, sir,"" he said. ""Just a second while I hop out, and I'll move it for you.""

""With bare hands?"" Cutter joked.

""With bare hands,"" Kurt replied.

Cutter laughed loudly and gave the truck's fender a friendly punch as he walked by. Kurt laughed too.

Cutter enjoyed joking with Kurt and the other truck drivers. They were simple guys, not as mentally sharp as he was, but they had a different kind of strength. They had muscles, energy, and most importantly, guts. Twenty years ago, Cutter had been a truck driver himself. The drivers knew that, and it created a bond between them—a bond that rarely existed between bosses and workers.

The guard at the door came to attention, and Cutter nodded curtly. Instead of taking the stairs to his office on the second floor, he walked through the shop on the first floor. He always did this because he liked the loud sounds of machines and the sight of strong men in their work clothes. Here, too, there was a bond between Cutter and his employees. They respected him because they knew he had once been a machinist, then a tool and die operator, and finally a shop foreman. They were inspired by his energy, alertness, and confidence, which kept their production near the top level of efficiency.

Cutter climbed the concrete steps to the second floor quickly and smoothly, not even slightly out of breath. He crossed the administrative office, which housed Production Control, Procurement, and Purchasing. Here, his enthusiasm dimmed a bit. The room was filled with rows of desks and men he didn't like—fragile men, pale and weak in his eyes. They pretended to be strong behind their desks, but Cutter knew they were just posing. He didn't understand them because he had never been like them. The usual bond between employer and employee was cold and brittle here, like frozen cellophane.

The sounds of typewriters, file drawers, and squeaky chairs irritated him. He hurried past one man with sad, frightened eyes, who touched his papers cautiously. What was his name? Linden? Cutter thought he was the epitome of this weak breed—slow and hesitant. Cutter promised himself that someday he would shout ""Boo!"" at Linden just to scare him.

Cutter pushed through the glass doors to his office, where Lucile, his secretary, greeted him. Lucile was matronly yet quick, and her smile restored Cutter's good mood. She was efficient and reminded him of the drive for accomplishment that he had dedicated himself to.

""Beautiful morning, Lucy,"" he said.

""Beautiful, George,"" she replied. She had called him by his first name for years, and he respected her for it.

""What's up first?"" he asked, and she followed him into his office. It was a high-ceilinged room with bare walls except for a picture of Alexander Hamilton and a Chamber of Commerce award plaque. He sat in his leather chair and opened his appointment pad.

""Quay wants to see you right away. Says it's important.""

Cutter nodded, closed his eyes, and listened as Lucile listed his appointments for the day. He stored the information and adjusted his mind to each task, ensuring no energy was wasted during the day.

""That's it,"" Lucile said. ""Do you want to see Quay?""

""Send him in,"" Cutter said, already signing letters he had dictated the day before.

Lucile left, and three minutes later, Robert Quay took her place in the chair beside Cutter's desk. Quay was taller and thinner than Cutter but had a confident, athletic grace. He had been with Cutter Products, Inc. for thirteen years and was a rare combination of brains and athleticism that Cutter liked.

""Beautiful morning, Bob,"" Cutter said.

""It really is, George,"" Quay replied.

""What's up?"" Cutter asked, looking directly into Quay's eyes.

""I've got a report from Sid Perry at Adacam Research.""

""Your undercover agent again, eh?""

Quay smiled. Adacam Research did industrial experiments, including government work. Cutter had found a key man, Sidney Perry, who didn't mind talking for compensation.

""What's Adacam doing?"" Cutter asked.

""A guy offered Adacam his project for testing. They're interested, but they won't handle it.""

""Why not?""

""Too touchy. It's an electronic device.""

""What's touchy about electronics?""

""This one affects human personality,"" Quay explained.

Cutter understood. ""Anything involving human personality scares them, doesn't it?""

Quay nodded.

""What's the device supposed to do?""

""It produces energy that affects the human ego.""

""Will it work?"" Cutter was always direct—would it work or not? Efficiency versus inefficiency.

""Sid says they're convinced it will. The theory checks out, but there's been no experimentation.""

""What's the effect?""

""It dissolves inferiority and inhibitions, creating a clear mind and a healthy ego.""

""And?""

""Confidence.""

Cutter considered this. ""How does it fit with Cutter Products?""

Quay showed him the efficiency report. ""Administrative departments showed a 36.8% less efficiency than labor departments.""

""I've known that for years,"" Cutter said.

""Babcock and Steele's report offered no answer. Administrative personnel have more inferiority issues, leading to less confidence and efficiency.""

""I remember all that,"" Cutter said.

""The report says this loss of efficiency is balanced by smaller wages.""

Cutter reddened with anger. ""A 36.8% efficiency loss is a loss in profits. Can this fix it?""

Quay nodded. ""It's worth a try. Bolen will install enough units for the whole administrative force for free. He needs actual tests, and we get the benefits for nothing.""

Cutter thought quickly. ""Call Horner, but keep it secret. Get a contract with Bolen assuming responsibility for any unexpected effects. Let's see what happens.""

Quay smiled, knowing he'd done a good job. ""Right, George.""

Edward Bolen called the device a Confidet. He was a thin, short man with a quick, certain way of moving. Only Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were present when Bolen installed the disks in chair cushions. 

""The energy is inside each one,"" Bolen explained. ""The life is indefinite, and the amount of energy used matches the demand created.""

""What do you mean by energy?"" Cutter asked.

Bolen laughed, and Cutter, usually unamused, didn't react but studied Bolen's hidden strength. Quay wondered how long Bolen would keep the rights if the gadget worked.

Cutter drove home in his Cadillac, heading to his massive stone house. His handyman took over the car as Cutter went inside. Mary, his wife, was waiting for him in the library. She was a large woman but not fat, and she had a pleasant demeanor.

Mary was always concerned about others, which annoyed Cutter, but she ran the house perfectly. She kissed him and asked about his day. He told her it was fine and agreed to have the roast beef she had prepared.

As he relaxed in his chair with a drink, he thought about the Confidet. It could fix the last efficiency issue, allowing him to expand. He closed his eyes, feeling content, and then went to eat dinner.

Three weeks later, Quay gave Cutter a report showing a 3.7% efficiency increase. ""This should tell the story,"" Quay said excitedly.

""It doesn't mean anything,"" Cutter said. ""Could be a thousand other reasons besides that gadget.""

""But we've never shown more than 1.5% variance,"" Quay argued.

""You keep looking for miracles,"" Cutter said. ""Nothing comes easy. I've half a mind to pull those silly things out.""

Cutter was pleased with the numbers, though, and knew they were significant. In two weeks, if the increase continued, they might have a real improvement. Even Linden, the clerk with sad eyes, might improve.

The efficiency increased to 8.9% after another two weeks. Quay was too excited to be knocked down, and Cutter couldn't hide his pleasure.

""It's really working, George,"" Quay said. ""Accounting estimates the profit on this increase.""

""We won't see that for a while,"" Cutter said, ""but we'll see it.""

""What does Bolen think the top increase is?""

""Ten percent.""

""Why not 36.8?"" Cutter asked.

Even at ten percent, Quay said, they'd balance out. Cutter wanted the whole thing. ""Send for Bolen. I want to talk to him.""

Bolen arrived the next morning, smiling and inspecting Cutter's office as if looking into Cutter's brain.

""Quay says ten percent is the top efficiency increase, Bolen,"" Cutter said.

""That's right,"" Bolen replied.

""Why?""

""It's a matter of saturation,"" Bolen explained.

""How does ten percent more efficiency become saturation?""

""Not ten percent more efficiency,"" Bolen said. ""Ten percent effect on the individual who creates the efficiency.""

Cutter snorted. ""The gadget creates confidence, drive, strength, right?""

""Yes,"" Bolen said. ""Approximately.""

""Explain how ten percent more confidence is saturation.""

Bolen smiled. ""Some men are different than others, Mr. Cutter. Some react differently to personality changes.""

""I'm only interested in efficiency,"" Cutter said. ""Tell me about efficiency.""

Bolen explained they didn't know which men were affected more. The average increase was 8.9%, but some workers might not react because they didn't lack confidence.

""All right, we'll find that deadwood and replace them,"" Cutter said.

""How will you know which are deadwood?"" Bolen asked.

""Individual checks, of course,"" Cutter replied.

""It won't necessarily work,"" Bolen said. ""The work isn't particularly demanding, so you need a balance between capability and demand.""

""Good,"" Cutter said. ""Any man whose capability outweighs the work will increase efficiency.""

""No,"" Bolen said. ""He'll lose interest, and efficiency will drop.""

Cutter's jaw tightened. ""I'll move him up and fill his place.""

Bolen examined Cutter's eyes. ""Some men have a lot of latent talent. Released talent—""

Cutter laughed. ""You think I can't handle it?""

""Let's say you have gentle mares and turn them into thoroughbreds. You might need to change the stable,"" Bolen said.

""Nothing affects the owner,"" Cutter said. ""If I have to make changes, fine. But nothing really affects the owner.""

Bolen nodded. ""You're a very certain man, Mr. Cutter.""

""Would I be here if I weren't?"" Cutter asked.

Bolen smiled.

""Do we go on?"" Cutter asked. ""Do we shoot for the limit?""

""I'm interested in testing the Confidet,"" Bolen said. ""I don't recommend what you want, but if you'll give me reports, I'll go along. If you dissolve our contract.""

Cutter hesitated, then nodded. ""All right, Bolen.""

Bolen smiled and left, and Cutter relaxed, feeling ambitious again. He called to order a chair for Mary's birthday, matching the antique desk he had bought her.

Mary loved her gift and used the chair daily. Within a month, Cutter noticed changes. She hosted a dinner for thirty without crying once.

Other changes were happening too. The efficiency reports Quay brought in showed an 18.7% increase. The administration office thrived, and individuals like Harry Linden showed amazing improvement.

Linden's efficiency increased by 60%, and he became a department head. Cutter planned to install Confidets in other departments, and profits began to show. But Quay resigned, which surprised Cutter.

Quay had bought a boat and was taking people fishing for a living. He had also married, which Cutter dismissed as insanity.

By February, Harry Linden had taken Quay's old job, and the efficiency average hit 33%. Cutter planned to expand, but then Mary sued for divorce. She left with her clothes, jewelry, and the second Cadillac, leaving behind only the antique desk and chair. When the trial ended, she won enough to move to France.

Cutter was worried for the first time in his life. Stocks in the company turned over rapidly, and his intuition told him to prepare for trouble.

The explosion came in July. Drindor Products bought 49% of the stock, using secondary buyers. Cutter realized Harry Linden had leaked information to Drindor, and he lost control. Linden became Vice President In Charge.

Cutter had Bolen remove the Confidets, but it was too late. Bolen's knowing look infuriated Cutter, but Bolen calmly took the disks away. Cutter left his office slowly that final day.

He brooded at home, trying to figure out how to regain control of the company he had built. He still had enough stock to live comfortably, but he thirsted for power. His eyes fell on the desk and chair, and he remembered he hadn't removed the Confidet from the chair.

He took the disk and placed it under the cushion of his leather chair in the library.

By fall, Cutter had done nothing to regain control. He drove by the plant, careful not to be seen, and was frightened by the thought of facing Harry Linden. He missed Mary and wrote pleading letters, but they came back unopened.

Finally, he visited Robert Quay, who lived in a small cottage by the beach. Quay's wife was kind and made Cutter feel at ease.

They talked about old times, and Cutter asked why Quay had left.

Quay admitted he had used a Confidet. ""All my life, I wanted to do what I'm doing now. But things came easy, and I never had the guts to pass anything by. Finally, I did.""

Cutter realized there was something wrong with his Confidet. It had worked for everyone else, but not for him. Maybe the energy had been used up, or maybe there was something wrong with him.

""Do you still have it?"" Cutter asked about Quay's Confidet.

""No, I gave it to Bolen,"" Quay said.

Cutter left, angry, and drove to Bolen's house. He was furious that Bolen had been using him for experiments and that his Confidet hadn't worked.

But when he saw Bolen, Cutter couldn't bring himself to demand another Confidet. He even managed a smile.

""You've been using that Confidet, haven't you?"" Bolen asked gently.

Cutter nodded.

""It wasn't the Confidet's fault,"" Bolen said. ""You were a complete super ego. The Confidet had the reverse effect on you.""

Cutter's anger was a wild thing inside him, but he couldn't show it. He didn't have the nerve.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around George H. Cutter's struggle with adapting to changes within his company and managing his own ego. The introduction of the Confidet device, which is designed to enhance confidence and efficiency by affecting human personality, creates unexpected consequences for Cutter both professionally and personally.

Initially, Cutter is intrigued by the potential of the Confidet to solve the efficiency issues in his administrative department. However, the device unexpectedly empowers his employees, leading to a dramatic shift in company dynamics. This culminates in Cutter losing control of his company to Harry Linden, a previously timid employee who rises to a position of power.

On a personal level, Cutter's wife Mary, also influenced by the Confidet, gains the confidence to leave him, further destabilizing his life. Cutter's attempts to regain control over his company and personal life are ultimately futile, revealing his inability to adapt to the empowerment of those around him.

The dilemma Cutter faces is a classic struggle between maintaining control versus embracing change. His inability to let go of his authoritarian approach and acknowledge the changing dynamics within his company and personal life leads to his downfall.

**AFTERWARD**

*January 1910*

**I**

""Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never know it.""

This statement, made jokingly six months earlier in a bright June garden, suddenly came back to Mary Boyne with a jolt of its hidden meaning as she stood in the December dusk, waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library.

The words were spoken by their friend Alida Stair while they sat at tea on her lawn at Pangbourne, referring to the very house whose library Mary was now in. Mary and her husband, looking for a country place in England, had gone to Alida Stair for advice. After rejecting several suggestions, she mentioned: “Well, there’s Lyng, in Dorsetshire. It belongs to Hugo’s cousins, and you can get it for a song.”

The reasons it was available for such a low price—its remoteness, lack of modern amenities—were exactly why Mary and her husband, Ned, were interested. They were romantic Americans looking for the economic drawbacks that came with unusual architectural features.

""I should never believe I was living in an old house unless I was thoroughly uncomfortable,"" Ned joked. They refused to believe the house was truly Tudor until they learned it had no heating system, or that the village church was literally on the grounds until they were assured of the poor water supply.

“It’s too uncomfortable to be true!” Ned exclaimed. But he suddenly asked, “And the ghost? You’ve been hiding the fact that there is no ghost!”

Mary had laughed with him but noticed a sudden change in Alida’s tone as she replied, “Oh, Dorsetshire’s full of ghosts, you know.”

“Yes, but I want one of my own on the premises. IS there a ghost at Lyng?”

“There IS one, of course, but you’ll never know it,” Alida had said, teasingly.

“Never know it?” Boyne asked. “But what makes a ghost except being known as one?”

“I can’t say. But that’s the story.”

“That there’s a ghost, but nobody knows it’s a ghost?”

“Well—not till afterward, at any rate.”

“But if it’s been identified as a ghost, why hasn’t it been passed down in the family? How has it kept its secret?”

Alida could only shake her head and say, “Don’t ask me. But it has.”

Mary spoke up, “Suddenly, long afterward, one says to oneself, ‘THAT WAS it?’”

She was startled by the sound of her own voice and saw the same surprise in Alida’s eyes. ""I suppose so. One just has to wait.""

“Life’s too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect. Can’t we do better than that, Mary?” Ned asked.

But they didn’t need to. Within three months, they were living at Lyng, experiencing the life they had dreamed of.

It was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary had endured the ugliness of the Middle West for fourteen years, and that Ned had worked tirelessly at engineering. The Blue Star Mine had suddenly given them the means to live the life they had longed for.

They never intended their new life to be one of idleness; they wanted to engage in harmonious activities. Mary dreamed of painting and gardening, while Ned planned to write his long-planned book on the “Economic Basis of Culture.” With such fulfilling work, they wanted to be far from the world and deep in the past.

Dorsetshire seemed remote, though geographically close to other parts of England. For Mary and Ned, it was a wonder how few miles made such a distance, and how short a distance made such a difference.

“It’s that,” Ned said, “that gives such depth to their effects, such relief to their contrasts. They’ve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful.”

The butter had indeed been laid thick at Lyng. The old gray house, hidden under the downs, had the marks of a long history. It wasn’t large or exceptional, but to Mary and Ned, it was rich with life’s special sense.

The life probably wasn’t very vivid; it had likely faded into the past like the quiet drizzle of autumn into the green fish-pond. But Mary felt the occasional brush of an intense memory.

The feeling was strongest on a December afternoon. Her husband was out on one of his long walks, and she felt restless in his absence. She concluded that his book was bothering him and that he needed to think over the morning’s work alone. The book wasn’t going smoothly, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there before. Yet, the few pages he had read to her showed a firm grasp of the subject and deepening confidence in his writing.

This perplexed her, as now he had no business worries. She wondered if it was his health, but he seemed healthier since they arrived in Dorsetshire. It was only in the last week that she sensed a change in him, making her restless in his absence and tongue-tied in his presence.

The thought of a secret between them struck her, and she looked around the dim library.

“Can it be the house?” she mused.

The room seemed full of secrets, piling up like layers of velvet shadows. “Why, of course—the house is haunted!” she thought.

Alida’s ghost, once a source of banter, had been discarded as too ineffectual. Mary had asked the rural neighbors, but they had little to share. The elusive specter had never had enough identity for a legend. Mary concluded that Lyng was one of the few houses good enough to do without supernatural enhancements.

“And I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that’s why it beats its wings in vain in the void,” she had laughed.

“Or, rather,” Ned replied, “why, amid so much that’s ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence.”

Now, as she stood by the hearth, her curiosity revived with a new sense of its meaning. The house, of course, possessed the ghost-seeing faculty, communing secretly with its past. If she could get close enough to the house, she might surprise its secret. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in the library, her husband had acquired the ghost-sight. Mary knew one couldn’t talk about ghosts one saw; it was as great a breach of good-breeding as naming a lady in a club.

But this explanation didn’t satisfy her. What would Ned care for any of their old ghosts? She was thrown back on the dilemma: when one saw a ghost at Lyng, one didn’t know it.

“Not till afterward,” Alida had said. What if Ned had seen one when they first came and only realized it in the past week? Under the spell of the hour, she thought back to their early days at Lyng. She recalled an October afternoon when she had discovered a hidden staircase leading to the roof. The view was enchanting, and she had called Ned to see her discovery.

She remembered how, standing on the ledge, he had held her while they gazed at the horizon and the grounds below. Just then, she noticed his arm relax and heard him exclaim, “Hullo!”

She glanced at him and saw anxiety on his face. Following his eyes, she saw a man in grayish clothes walking down the lime-avenue. Her short-sighted eyes gave a blurred impression, but Ned seemed to see more and dashed down the stairs after him.

Dizziness made her descend more cautiously, and when she reached the attic landing, she paused. She lingered until she heard a door close below, then went down to the hall.

The front door was open, and the hall was empty. She crossed to the library and found Ned alone, fingering papers on his desk.

He looked surprised at her entrance, but the anxiety had passed from his face.

“What was it? Who was it?” she asked.

“Who?” he repeated.

“The man we saw coming toward the house.”

He seemed to reflect. “The man? I thought I saw Peters; I dashed after him, but he disappeared.”

“Disappeared? He seemed to be walking slowly.”

Ned shrugged. “So I thought; but he must have sped up. What do you say to a scramble up Meldon Steep before sunset?”

At the time, the occurrence had been trivial, obliterated by their first vision from Meldon Steep. But now, the memory emerged with new significance. Why had Peters made him anxious? Why, if it was crucial to speak to Peters, did his failure to find him bring relief?

Mary couldn’t say these thoughts occurred to her at the time, yet she felt they had been waiting their hour.

**II**

Weary with her thoughts, Mary moved toward the window. The library was dark, and she was surprised at the faint light outside.

As she peered out, a figure appeared in the perspective of the bare lines. It looked like a blot of deeper gray, and for a moment, her heart thumped with the thought, “It’s the ghost!”

She had time to feel that the man she had seen was about to reveal himself as not being Peters. But almost instantly, the figure showed itself as her husband’s; she turned to meet him, confessing her folly.

“It’s too absurd,” she laughed, “but I never can remember!”

“Remember what?” Boyne questioned.

“That when one sees the Lyng ghost, one never knows it.”

Her hand was on his sleeve, but there was no response in his gesture or face.

“Did you think you’d seen it?” he asked.

“Why, I actually took YOU for it, in my mad determination to spot it!”

“Me—just now?” His arm dropped away, and he turned, echoing her laugh. “Really, dearest, you’d better give it up.”

“Yes, I give it up. Have YOU?” she asked.

The parlor-maid entered with letters and a lamp, striking light into Boyne’s face as he bent over the tray.

“Have you?” Mary insisted.

“Have I what?” he rejoined, the light bringing out the worry between his brows.

“Given up trying to see the ghost.” Her heart beat at the experiment.

Her husband moved into the shadow of the hearth. “I never tried,” he said, tearing the wrapper of a newspaper.

“Well, of course,” Mary persisted, “the exasperating thing is that there’s no use trying, since one can’t be sure till afterward.”

He unfolded the paper as if he hadn’t heard her. But after a pause, he lifted his head to say, “Have you any idea how long?”

Mary looked up at his profile, darkly projected against the lamplight. “No; none. Have YOU?” she retorted.

Boyne crumpled the paper and turned to the lamp. “Lord, no! I only meant, is there any legend, any tradition, as to that?”

“Not that I know of,” she answered; but she held back the impulse to ask, “What makes you ask?”

With the dispersal of shadows, Mary felt less oppressed by the sense of something imminent. She gave herself to her task, and when she looked up, she was bewildered by the change in her husband’s face. He was absorbed in his letters; was it something in them, or the shift of her view, that restored his features to normal? The longer she looked, the more the change affirmed itself. The lines of tension vanished, and traces of fatigue seemed due to mental effort. He met her eyes with a smile.

“I’m dying for my tea, you know; and here’s a letter for you,” he said.

She took the letter, noting his composure, yet felt the need for reassurance.

“But doesn’t this suit worry you? Why haven’t you spoken to me about it?”

He answered both questions: “I didn’t speak of it at first because it DID worry me. But it’s ancient history now. Your correspondent must have got a back number of the ‘Sentinel.’”

She felt relief. “You mean it’s over? He’s lost his case?”

Boyne paused. “The suit’s been withdrawn—that’s all.”

She persisted. “Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?”

“Oh, he had no chance,” Boyne answered.

She was still struggling with a perplexity.

“How long ago was it withdrawn?”

He paused. “I’ve just had the news now; but I’ve been expecting it.”

“Just now—in one of your letters?”

“Yes; in one of my letters.”

She was aware only after a short interval that he had risen and placed himself on the sofa beside her. She felt his arm pass around her, his hand seek hers, and turning, she met the smiling clearness of his eyes.

“It’s all right—it’s all right?” she questioned; and “I give you my word it never was righter!” he laughed back at her.

**III**

One of the strangest things she was afterward to recall was the sudden recovery of her sense of security.

It was in the air when she woke in her low-ceilinged room; it accompanied her down-stairs to the breakfast-table, and re-duplicated itself from the urn and teapot. It was as if all her fears, with their moment of concentration about the newspaper article, had liquidated some moral obligation. If she had been careless of her husband’s affairs, it was because her faith in him justified such carelessness.

She had never seen him more untroubled than after her questions: it was as if he had wanted the air cleared as much as she did.

It was as clear as the bright light that surprised her when she went out for her daily round of the gardens. She had left Boyne at his desk, indulging in a last peep at his quiet face, and now she had her morning’s task.

The task involved as much delighted loitering as if spring were at work. There were so many possibilities to bring out the latent graces of the place, without alteration, that the winter months were too short to plan what spring and autumn executed. Her recovered sense of safety gave a peculiar zest to her progress through the place. She went first to the kitchen-garden, where the espaliered pear-trees drew patterns on the walls, and pigeons fluttered about the roof of their cot. There was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse, and she expected an authority from Dorchester to come and diagnose the boiler. But when she dipped into the greenhouses, even the flora of Lyng was in the note! She learned that the man hadn’t arrived, and the day being too rare to waste, she came out again and paced along the turf to the gardens behind the house.

At their end rose a terrace, commanding a view of the house-front, all drenched in air.

Seen thus, it sent her the look of some warm human presence, of a mind ripened on a sunny wall of experience. She had never had such a sense of her intimacy with it, such a conviction that its secrets were beneficent, kept “for one’s good,” so complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and Ned’s into the pattern of the long, long story it sat there weaving in the sun.

She heard steps and turned, expecting the gardener and the engineer. But only one figure was in sight, that of a youngish man who didn’t resemble her notion of an authority on boilers. The new-comer lifted his hat and paused with the air of a gentleman desiring to make known that his intrusion was involuntary.

The local fame of Lyng occasionally attracted sight-seers, and Mary half-expected to see the stranger dissemble a camera. But he made no gesture, and she asked, “Is there anyone you wish to see?”

“I came to see Mr. Boyne,” he replied, his intonation faintly American.

Mary, at the familiar note, looked at him more closely. The brim of his hat cast a shade on his face, giving it a serious look, as of a person arriving “on business,” firmly aware of his rights.

Past experience made Mary sensible to such claims; but she was jealous of her husband’s morning hours.

“Have you an appointment with Mr. Boyne?” she asked.

He hesitated. “Not exactly an appointment,” he replied.

“Then I’m afraid, this being his working-time, he can’t receive you now. Will you give me a message, or come back later?”

The visitor, again lifting his hat, replied he would come back later, and walked away, looking up at the house-front; and it struck her that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a distance, and to offer to inquire if her husband could receive him. But as the thought occurred, he passed out of sight, and at the same moment, her attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener and the boiler-maker.

The encounter led to such issues that they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train, and beguiled Mary into spending the morning in absorbed confabulation among the greenhouses. She was startled to find it was nearly lunchtime, and she half expected to see her husband coming out to meet her. But she found no one in the court but an under-gardener raking gravel.

Not wishing to disturb him, she turned into the drawing-room, lost in renewed calculations of the outlay to which the conference had committed her. The knowledge she could permit herself such follies hadn’t lost its novelty; and against the vague fears of the previous days, it seemed an element of her safety.

She was luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlor-maid roused her with an inquiry as to serving luncheon. Trimmle announced luncheon as if divulging a secret, and Mary murmured assent.

She felt Trimmle wavering expressively, then her steps sounded down the passage, and Mary crossed the hall and went to the library door. It was closed, and she wavered, disliking to disturb her husband. As she stood, balancing her impulses, Trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon, and Mary, thus impelled, opened the door and went into the library.

Boyne was not at his desk, and she peered about, expecting to discover him at the book-shelves, but her call brought no response, and it became clear that he was not in the library.

She turned back to the parlor-maid. “Mr. Boyne must be upstairs. Please tell him that luncheon is ready.”

The parlor-maid hesitated. “If you please, Madam, Mr. Boyne’s not upstairs.”

“Not in his room? Are you sure?”

“I’m sure, Madam.”

Mary consulted the clock. “Where is he, then?”

“He’s gone out,” Trimmle announced.

“Gone out? At this hour?” Mary went to the door and glanced across the court through the lime trees. But it was as empty as when she entered.

“Did Mr. Boyne leave no message?” she asked.

Trimmle struggled with the forces of chaos. “No, Madam. He just went out with the gentleman.”

“The gentleman? What gentleman?” Mary turned to face this new factor.

“The gentleman who called, Madam,” said Trimmle, resignedly.

“When did a gentleman call? Do explain yourself, Trimmle!”

Only hunger and wanting to consult her husband would have made her speak so. Even now, she noted in Trimmle’s eye the defiance of the subordinate who has been pressed too hard.

“I couldn’t exactly say the hour, Madam, because I didn’t let the gentleman in,” she replied.

“You didn’t let him in?”

“No, Madam. When the bell rang I was dressing, and Agnes—”

“Go and ask Agnes, then,” Mary interjected. Trimmle wore her look of patient magnanimity. “Agnes would not know, Madam, for she had burnt her hand trying the new lamp from town—” Trimmle had always been opposed to the new lamp—“and so Mrs. Dockett sent the kitchen-maid instead.”

Mary looked again at the clock. “It’s after two! Go and ask the kitchen-maid if Mr. Boyne left any word.”

She went into luncheon without waiting, and Trimmle brought the kitchen-maid’s statement that the gentleman had called about one o’clock, that Mr. Boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message. The kitchen-maid didn’t know the caller’s name, for he had written it on paper and handed it to her to give to Mr. Boyne.

Mary finished her luncheon, wondering, and when it was over, and Trimmle had brought coffee to the drawing-room, her wonder deepened to disquietude. It was unlike Boyne to absent himself without explanation at an unusual hour, and the difficulty of identifying the visitor made his disappearance more unaccountable. Mary’s experience as the wife of a busy engineer, subject to sudden calls and irregular hours, had trained her to accept surprises; but since Boyne’s withdrawal from business, he had adopted regularity of life, discouraging her fancy for the unexpected. Once or twice, now that this new life had drawn its circle about them, she had wondered if she had done right; but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the excursions of an active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her to find how little she knew of the foundation on which her happiness was built.

She glanced again at her husband, reassured by his composure; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance.

“But doesn’t this suit worry you? Why have you never spoken to me about it?”

He answered both questions: “I didn’t speak of it at first because it DID worry me. But it’s ancient history now. Your correspondent must have got a back number of the ‘Sentinel.’”

She felt relief. “You mean it’s over? He’s lost his case?”

Boyne paused. “The suit’s been withdrawn—that’s all.”

But she persisted, as if to exonerate herself from being too easily put off. “Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?”

“Oh, he had no chance,” Boyne answered.

She was still struggling with perplexity.

“How long ago was it withdrawn?”

He paused. “I’ve just had the news now; but I’ve been expecting it.”

“Just now—in one of your letters?”

“Yes; in one of my letters.”

She made no answer, and was aware only, after a short interval, that he had risen and put himself on the sofa beside her. She felt him pass an arm about her, she felt his hand seek hers, and turning slowly, drawn by the warmth of his cheek, she met the smiling clearness of his eyes.

“It’s all right—it’s all right?” she questioned; and “I give you my word it never was righter!” he laughed back at her.

**III**

One of the strangest things she was afterward to recall was the sudden recovery of her sense of security.

It was in the air when she woke in her low-ceilinged room; it accompanied her to the breakfast-table, and re-duplicated itself from the urn and teapot. It was as if all her fears, with their moment of concentration about the newspaper article, had liquidated some moral obligation. If she had been careless of her husband’s affairs, it was because her faith in him justified such carelessness.

She had never seen him more untroubled than after her questions: it was as if he had wanted the air cleared as much as she did.

It was as clear as the bright light that surprised her when she went out for her daily round of the gardens. She had left Boyne at his desk, indulging in a last peep at his quiet face, and now she had her morning’s task.

The task involved as much delighted loitering as if spring were at work. There were so many possibilities to bring out the latent graces of the place, without alteration, that the winter months were too short to plan what spring and autumn executed. Her recovered sense of safety gave a peculiar zest to her progress through the place. She went first to the kitchen-garden, where the espaliered pear-trees drew patterns on the walls, and pigeons fluttered about the roof of their cot. There was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse, and she expected an authority from Dorchester to come and diagnose the boiler. But when she dipped into the greenhouses, even the flora of Lyng was in the note! She learned that the man hadn’t arrived, and the day being too rare to waste, she came out again and paced along the turf to the gardens behind the house.

At their end rose a terrace, commanding a view of the house-front, all drenched in air.

Seen thus, it sent her the look of some warm human presence, of a mind ripened on a sunny wall of experience. She had never had such a sense of her intimacy with it, such a conviction that its secrets were beneficent, kept “for one’s good,” so complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and Ned’s into the pattern of the long, long story it sat there weaving in the sun.

She heard steps and turned, expecting the gardener and the engineer. But only one figure was in sight, that of a youngish man who didn’t resemble her notion of an authority on boilers. The new-comer lifted his hat and paused with the air of a gentleman desiring to make known that his intrusion was involuntary.

The local fame of Lyng occasionally attracted sight-seers, and Mary half-expected to see the stranger dissemble a camera. But he made no gesture, and she asked, “Is there anyone you wish to see?”

“I came to see Mr. Boyne,” he replied, his intonation faintly American.

Mary, at the familiar note, looked at him more closely. The brim of his hat cast a shade on his face, giving it a serious look, as of a person arriving “on business,” firmly aware of his rights.

Past experience made Mary sensible to such claims; but she was jealous of her husband’s morning hours.

“Have you an appointment with Mr. Boyne?” she asked.

He hesitated. “Not exactly an appointment,” he replied.

“Then I’m afraid, this being his working-time, he can’t receive you now. Will you give me a message, or come back later?”

The visitor, again lifting his hat, replied he would come back later, and walked away, looking up at the house-front; and it struck her that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a distance, and to offer to inquire if her husband could receive him. But as the thought occurred, he passed out of sight, and at the same moment, her attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener and the boiler-maker.

The encounter led to such issues that they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train, and beguiled Mary into spending the morning in absorbed confabulation among the greenhouses. She was startled to find it was nearly lunchtime, and she half expected to see her husband coming out to meet her. But she found no one in the court but an under-gardener raking gravel.

Not wishing to disturb him, she turned into the drawing-room, lost in renewed calculations of the outlay to which the conference had committed her. The knowledge she could permit herself such follies hadn’t lost its novelty; and against the vague fears of the previous days, it seemed an element of her safety.

She was luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlor-maid roused her with an inquiry as to serving luncheon. Trimmle announced luncheon as if divulging a secret, and Mary murmured assent.

She felt Trimmle wavering expressively, then her steps sounded down the passage, and Mary crossed the hall and went to the library door. It was closed, and she wavered, disliking to disturb her husband. As she stood, balancing her impulses, Trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon, and Mary, thus impelled, opened the door and went into the library.

Boyne was not at his desk, and she peered about, expecting to discover him at the book-shelves, but her call brought no response, and it became clear that he was not in the library.

She turned back to the parlor-maid. “Mr. Boyne must be upstairs. Please tell him that luncheon is ready.”

The parlor-maid hesitated. “If you please, Madam, Mr. Boyne’s not upstairs.”

“Not in his room? Are you sure?”

“I’m sure, Madam.”

Mary consulted the clock. “Where is he, then?”

“He’s gone out,” Trimmle announced.

“Gone out? At this hour?” Mary went to the door and glanced across the court through the lime trees. But it was as empty as when she entered.

“Did Mr. Boyne leave no message?” she asked.

Trimmle struggled with the forces of chaos. “No, Madam. He just went out with the gentleman.”

“The gentleman? What gentleman?” Mary turned to face this new factor.

“The gentleman who called, Madam,” said Trimmle, resignedly.

“When did a gentleman call? Do explain yourself, Trimmle!”

Only hunger and wanting to consult her husband would have made her speak so. Even now, she noted in Trimmle’s eye the defiance of the subordinate who has been pressed too hard.

“I couldn’t exactly say the hour, Madam, because I didn’t let the gentleman in,” she replied.

“You didn’t let him in?”

“No, Madam. When the bell rang I was dressing, and Agnes—”

“Go and ask Agnes, then,” Mary interjected. Trimmle wore her look of patient magnanimity. “Agnes would not know, Madam, for she had burnt her hand trying the new lamp from town—” Trimmle had always been opposed to the new lamp—“and so Mrs. Dockett sent the kitchen-maid instead.”

Mary looked again at the clock. “It’s after two! Go and ask the kitchen-maid if Mr. Boyne left any word.”

She went into luncheon without waiting, and Trimmle brought the kitchen-maid’s statement that the gentleman had called about one o’clock, that Mr. Boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message. The kitchen-maid didn’t know the caller’s name, for he had written it on paper and handed it to her to give to Mr. Boyne.

Mary finished her luncheon, wondering, and when it was over, and Trimmle had brought coffee to the drawing-room, her wonder deepened to disquietude. It was unlike Boyne to absent himself without explanation at an unusual hour, and the difficulty of identifying the visitor made his disappearance more unaccountable. Mary’s experience as the wife of a busy engineer, subject to sudden calls and irregular hours, had trained her to accept surprises; but since Boyne’s withdrawal from business, he had adopted regularity of life, discouraging her fancy for the unexpected. Once or twice, now that this new life had drawn its circle about them, she had wondered if she had done right; but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the excursions of an active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her to find how little she knew of the foundation on which her happiness was built.

She glanced again at her husband, reassured by his composure; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance.

“But doesn’t this suit worry you? Why haven’t you spoken to me about it?”

He answered both questions: “I didn’t speak of it at first because it DID worry me. But it’s ancient history now. Your correspondent must have got a back number of the ‘Sentinel.’”

She felt relief. “You mean it’s over? He’s lost his case?”

Boyne paused. “The suit’s been withdrawn—that’s all.”

But she persisted, as if to exonerate herself from being too easily put off. “Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?”

“Oh, he had no chance,” Boyne answered.

She was still struggling with perplexity.

“How long ago was it withdrawn?”

He paused. “I’ve just had the news now; but I’ve been expecting it.”

“Just now—in one of your letters?”

“Yes; in one of my letters.”

She made no answer, and was aware only, after a short interval, that he had risen and put himself on the sofa beside her. She felt him pass an arm about her, she felt his hand seek hers, and turning slowly, drawn by the warmth of his cheek, she met the smiling clearness of his eyes.

“It’s all right—it’s all right?” she questioned; and “I give you my word it never was righter!” he laughed back at her.

The narrative is structured around the couple's move to an old house in Dorsetshire, which is rumored to have a ghost that one cannot identify until ""afterward."" This sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the themes of perception, reality, and the haunting nature of secrets.

Mary and Ned Boyne, having moved to the English countryside for a more fulfilling and picturesque life, encounter a dilemma when Ned vanishes without explanation after a mysterious visitor calls on him. The story's tension is compounded by the earlier conversation about the ghost of the house, which is only recognized in retrospect. This metaphorical ghost becomes a representation of the hidden past and unresolved issues that haunt the present.

Mary's conflict is both external and internal. Externally, she grapples with the disappearance of her husband and the lack of any logical or tangible reason for his absence. Internally, she faces the unsettling realization that there may have been aspects of her husband's life and their shared past that she was unaware of or chose to ignore.

Ultimately, the story's central conflict lies in the tension between the visible and the invisible, the known and the unknown, and the past's power to unexpectedly intrude upon and reshape the present. This conflict is resolved only in the sense that Mary is left to confront the aftermath of her husband's disappearance, embodying the story's haunting refrain—that the truth of the ghost is only known ""afterward.""",Imagine your husband vanishes after a strange visitor arrives.

003.txt,"Ben Tilman was sitting in a very comfortable chair, flipping through a magazine, and feeling restless. He was waiting in a fancy office to see his boss, the Old Man. Ben was annoyed, but he didn't know why. He had a great job and a happy family, but something still bothered him.

Ben was a good salesman, better than most. He had a lovely wife named Betty and a smart little son. He should have been content, but he wasn't. In the past year, Ben had quit three good jobs for silly reasons. He felt unhappy with his work and didn't know why.

At his last job with Ancestral Insurance, he was very successful. Then he met Betty, they got married, and things were good for a while. But soon, he got tired of his job and quit, complaining about paperwork. That was a lie, though. The truth was, he was just dissatisfied for no real reason.

Now, Ben had a new job with a big company called Amalgamated Production for Living, or ALPRODLIV. He was about to start an important sales project, and he was excited about it. The Old Man, his boss, was interested in Ben's new sales idea, which was a big deal.

Finally, the robot secretary told Ben it was time to see the Old Man. The Old Man was an old but great sales manager. When Ben talked to him, the Old Man seemed distracted at first, but then he focused on Ben. The Old Man asked Ben if everything was ready for the big sales pitch that night, and Ben assured him it was.

The Old Man was impressed with Ben's new sales strategy, which involved a softer approach to selling. He believed it would be a huge success. The Old Man was ready to launch a big campaign using Ben's sales method.

At home, Ben's wife, Betty, was preparing for the evening's event. They were hosting a house-warming party to show off their new home. Betty and Ben planned to use this as an opportunity to sell the house to their guests.

Their house was a special one provided by Amalgamated, and it had every modern convenience. Ben and Betty had invited three couples to the party, hoping to sell the idea of living in such a house.

During the party, Ben and Betty dropped hints about how great the house was, but they didn't make a direct sales pitch. They wanted to build suspense and curiosity among their guests.

Eventually, Ben revealed he was selling the house itself, along with all its features. The guests were surprised but impressed. Fred Stoddard, one of the guests, quickly decided to buy the house.

Later, Ben and Betty moved out of the house to let the Stoddards move in. They were heading to a vacation at Amalgamated's Guest-ville, a special place for employees.

Ben was still feeling a bit restless despite the successful sale. He thought about a vacation spot they had visited before, where people lived without modern machines. Ben found the simplicity of that life appealing.

The next morning, Ben went to work, and the Old Man praised him for his sales success. The Old Man suggested a new sales challenge: selling books. People had stopped reading, and the Old Man wanted Ben to change that.

Ben thought about a man he met on vacation who was writing a book. He believed it had potential. The Old Man, however, thought Ben needed a vacation.

In the end, Ben realized the Old Man was actually a robot, just like many others around him. He decided to take control of his life and go on vacation with his family, hoping to find happiness in a simpler life.

By Frank Herbert

""We should wipe out every living thing on this planet,"" muttered Umbo Stetson, the section chief of Investigation & Adjustment.

Stetson paced the landing control bridge of his scout cruiser. His footsteps echoed on a floor that was the back wall of the bridge during flight. But now the ship rested on its tail fins—all four hundred shiny red and black meters of it. The open windows of the bridge looked out over the jungle canopy of Gienah III, about one hundred fifty meters below. A butter-yellow sun hung above the horizon, maybe an hour from setting.

""Clean as an egg!"" he barked. He stopped his pacing, glared out the starboard window, and spat into the fire-blackened circle burned into the jungle by the cruiser’s jets.

The I-A section chief was dark-haired, lanky, with a large head and big features. He stood in his usual slouch, a stance not improved by his baggy, patched blue fatigues. Although he was leading this operation and ranked like a division admiral, his fatigues had no insignia. He looked a bit scruffy and unkempt.

Lewis Orne, a junior I-A field man fresh out of training, stood at the opposite window, looking at the jungle horizon. Now and then he glanced at the bridge control console, the clock above it, and the big map of their position angled from the opposite wall. A native of a heavy planet, he felt uneasy on this Gienah III with its gravity of only seven-eighths Terran Standard. The surgical scars on his neck where the micro-communications equipment had been inserted itched like crazy. He scratched.

""Hah!"" said Stetson. ""Politicians!""

A thin black insect with shiny wings flew in Orne’s window and landed in his short red hair. Orne gently pulled the insect from his hair and let it go. It tried to land in his hair again. He ducked, and it flew out the window beside Stetson.

Orne looked strong and muscular, with no fat, but something about his blocky, off-center features made him seem like a clown.

""I’m getting tired of waiting,"" he said.

""You’re tired! Hah!""

A breeze rippled the tops of the green ocean below them. Here and there, red and purple flowers jutted from the greenery, bending and nodding like an attentive audience.

""Just look at that blasted jungle!"" barked Stetson. ""Them and their stupid orders!""

A call bell rang on the bridge control console. The red light above the speaker grid started blinking. Stetson shot an angry glance at it. ""Yeah, Hal?""

""Okay, Stet. Orders just came through. We use Plan C. ComGO says to brief the field man and get out of here.""

""Did you ask them about using another field man?""

Orne looked up attentively.

The speaker said: ""Yes. They said we have to use Orne because of the records on the _Delphinus_.""

""Well then, will they give us more time to brief him?""

""Negative. It’s crash priority. ComGO expects to blast the planet anyway.""

Stetson glared at the grid. ""Those fat-headed, lard-bottomed, pig-brained ... POLITICIANS!"" He took two deep breaths, calmed down. ""Okay. Tell them we’ll comply.""

""One more thing, Stet.""

""What now?""

""I’ve got a confirmed contact.""

Instantly, Stetson was alert. ""Where?""

""About ten kilometers out. Section AAB-6.""

""How many?""

""A mob. You want I should count them?""

""No. What’re they doing?""

""Making a beeline for us. You better get a move on.""

""Okay. Keep us posted.""

""Right.""

Stetson looked across at his junior field man. ""Orne, if you decide you want out of this assignment, just say the word. I’ll back you to the hilt.""

""Why would I want out of my first field assignment?""

""Listen, and find out."" Stetson crossed to a locker behind the big map, hauled out a white coverall uniform with gold insignia, tossed it to Orne. ""Get into these while I brief you on the map.""

""But this is an R&R uni—"" began Orne.

""Get that uniform on your ugly frame!""

""Yes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir. Right away, sir. But I thought I was through with Rediscovery & Reeducation when you drafted me off of Hamal into the I-A ... sir."" He began changing from the I-A blue to the R&R white. Almost as an afterthought, he said: ""... Sir.""

A wolfish grin cracked Stetson’s big features. ""I’m soooooo happy you have the proper attitude of subservience toward authority.""

Orne zipped up the coverall uniform. ""Oh, yes, sir ... sir.""

""Okay, Orne, pay attention."" Stetson gestured at the map with its green grid squares. ""Here we are. Here’s that city we flew over on our way down. You’ll head for it as soon as we drop you. The place is big enough that if you hold a course roughly northeast you can’t miss it. We’re—""

Again the call bell rang.

""What is it this time, Hal?"" barked Stetson.

""They’ve changed to Plan H, Stet. New orders cut.""

""Five days?""

""That’s all they can give us. ComGO says he can’t keep the information out of High Commissioner Bullone’s hands any longer than that.""

""It’s five days for sure then.""

""Is this the usual R&R foul-up?"" asked Orne.

Stetson nodded. ""Thanks to Bullone and company! We’re just one step ahead of disaster, but they still cram the nonsense into the Rah & Rah boys back at dear old Uni-Galacta!""

""You’re making fun of my revered alma mater,"" said Orne. He struck a pose. ""We must reunite the lost planets with our centers of culture and industry, and take up the _glor_-ious onward march of mankind that was so _bru_-tally—""

""Stop it!"" snapped Stetson. ""We both know we’re going to rediscover one planet too many someday. Rim War all over again. But this is a different kind of problem. It’s not, repeat, _not_ a _re_-discovery.""

Orne sobered. ""Alien?""

""Yes. A-L-I-E-N! A never-before-contacted culture. That language you were force-fed on the way over, that’s an alien language. It’s not complete ... all we have off the _minis_. And we excluded data on the natives because we’ve been hoping to dump this project and nobody the wiser.""

""Yikes!""

""Twenty-six days ago an I-A search ship came through here, had a routine mini-sneaker look at the place. When he collected his net of sneakers to check the tapes and films, lo and behold, he had a little stranger.""

""One of _theirs_?""

""No. It was a _mini_ off the _Delphinus Rediscovery_. The _Delphinus_ has been missing for eighteen standard months!""

""Did it crash here?""

""We don’t know. If it did, we haven’t been able to spot it. She was supposed to be way off in the Balandine System by now. But we’ve something else on our minds. It’s the one thing that makes me want to wipe out this place and run home with my tail between my legs. We’ve a—""

Again the call bell chimed.

""NOW WHAT?"" roared Stetson into the speaker.

""I’ve got a _mini_ over that mob, Stet. They’re talking about us. It’s definitely a raiding party.""

""What armament?""

""Too dark in that jungle to be sure. The infra beam’s out on this _mini_. Looks like hard pellet rifles of some kind. Might even be off the _Delphinus_.""

""Can’t you get closer?""

""Wouldn’t do any good. No light down there, and they’re moving up fast.""

""Keep an eye on them, but don’t ignore the other sectors,"" said Stetson.

""You think I was born yesterday?"" barked the voice from the grid. The contact broke off with an angry sound.

""One thing I like about the I-A,"" said Stetson. ""It collects such even-tempered types."" He looked at the white uniform on Orne, wiped a hand across his mouth as though he’d tasted something dirty.

""Why _am_ I wearing this thing?"" asked Orne.

""Disguise.""

""But there’s no mustache!""

Stetson smiled without humor. ""That’s one of I-A’s answers to those fat-keistered politicians. We’re setting up our own search system to find the planets before _they_ do. We’ve managed to put spies in key places at R&R. Any touchy planets our spies report, we divert the files.""

""Then what?""

""Then we look into them with bright boys like you—disguised as R&R field men.""

""Goody, goody. And what happens if R&R stumbles onto me while I’m down there playing patty cake?""

""We disown you.""

""But you said an I-A ship found this joint.""

""It did. And then one of our spies in R&R intercepted a _routine_ request for an agent-instructor to be assigned here with full equipment. Request signed by a First-Contact officer named Diston ... of the _Delphinus_!""

""But the Del—""

""Yeah. Missing. The request was a forgery. Now you see why I’m mostly for wiping out this place. Who’d dare forge such a thing unless he knew for sure that the original FC officer was missing ... or dead?""

""What the ... heck are we doing here, Stet?"" asked Orne. ""Alien calls for a full contact team with all of the—""

""It calls for one planet-buster bomb ... buster—in five days. Unless you give them a white bill in the meantime. High Commissioner Bullone will have word of this planet by then. If Gienah III still exists in five days, can’t you imagine the fun the politicians’ll have with it? Mama mia! We want this planet cleared for contact or dead before then.""

""I don’t like this, Stet.""

""YOU don’t like it!""

""Look,"" said Orne. ""There must be another way. Why ... when we teamed up with the Alerinoids we gained five hundred years in the physical sciences alone, not to mention the—""

""The Alerinoids didn’t knock over one of our survey ships first.""

""What if the _Delphinus_ just crashed here ... and the locals picked up the pieces?""

""That’s what you’re going in to find out, Orne. But answer me this: If they _do_ have the _Delphinus_, how long before a tool-using race could be a threat to the galaxy?""

""I saw that city they built, Stet. They could be dug in within six months, and there’d be no—""

""Yeah.""

Orne shook his head. ""But think of it: Two civilizations that matured along different lines! Think of all the different ways we’d approach the same problems ... the lever that’d give us for—""

""You sound like a Uni-Galacta lecture! Are you through marching arm in arm into the misty future?""

Orne took a deep breath. ""Why’s a freshman like me being tossed into this dish?""

""You’d still be on the _Delphinus_ master lists as an R&R field man. That’s important if you’re masquerading.""

""Am I the only one? I know I’m a recent _convert_, but—""

""You want out?""

""I didn’t say that. I just want to know why I’m—""

""Because the big bosses fed a set of requirements into one of their iron monsters. Your card popped out. They were looking for somebody capable, dependable ... and ... _expendable_!""

""Hey!""

""That’s why I’m down here briefing you instead of sitting back on a flagship. _I_ got you into the I-A. Now, you listen carefully: If you push the panic button on this one without cause, I will personally flay you alive. We both know the advantages of an alien contact. But if you get into a hot spot, and call for help, I’ll dive this cruiser into that city to get you out!""

Orne swallowed. ""Thanks, Stet. I’m—""

""We’re going to take up a tight orbit. Out beyond us will be five transports full of I-A marines and a Class IX Monitor with one planet-buster. You’re calling the shots, God help you! First, we want to know if they have the _Delphinus_ ... and if so, where it is. Next, we want to know just how warlike these goons are. Can we control them if they’re bloodthirsty? What’s their potential?""

""In five days?""

""Not a second more.""

""What do we know about them?""

""Not much. They look something like an ancient Terran chimpanzee ... only with blue fur. Face is hairless, pink-skinned."" Stetson snapped a switch. The map became a screen with a figure frozen on it. ""Like that. This is life size.""

""Looks like the missing link they’re always hunting for,"" said Orne. ""Yeah, but you’ve got a different kind of a missing link.""

""Vertical-slit pupils in their eyes,"" said Orne. He studied the figure. It had been caught from the front by a mini-sneaker camera. About five feet tall. The stance was slightly bent forward, long arms. Two vertical nose slits. A flat, lipless mouth. Receding chin. Four-fingered hands. It wore a wide belt from which hung neat pouches and what looked like tools, although their use was unclear. There seemed to be the tip of a tail sticking out from behind one of the squat legs. Behind the creature stood the fairy spires of the city they’d seen from the air.

""Tails?"" asked Orne.

""Yeah. They’re arboreal. Not a road on the whole planet that we can find. But there are lots of vine lanes through the jungles."" Stetson’s face hardened. ""Match _that_ with a city as advanced as that one.""

""Slave culture?""

""Probably.""

""How many cities have they?""

""We’ve found two. This one and another on the other side of the planet. But the other one’s a ruin.""

""A ruin? Why?""

""You tell us. Lots of mysteries here.""

""What’s the planet like?""

""Mostly jungle. There are polar oceans, lakes and rivers. One low mountain chain follows the equator about two thirds around the planet.""

""But only two cities. Are you sure?""

""Reasonably so. It’d be pretty hard to miss something the size of that thing we flew over. It must be fifty kilometers long and at least ten wide. Swarming with these creatures, too. We’ve got a zone-count estimate that places the city’s population at over thirty million.""

""Whee-ew! Those are tall buildings, too.""

""We don’t know much about this place, Orne. And unless you bring them into the fold, there’ll be nothing but ashes for our archaeologists to pick over.""

""Seems a dirty shame.""

""I agree, but—""

The call bell jangled.

Stetson’s voice sounded tired: ""Yeah, Hal?""

""That mob’s only about five kilometers out, Stet. We’ve got Orne’s gear outside in the disguised air sled.""

""We’ll be right down.""

""Why a disguised sled?"" asked Orne.

""If they think it’s a ground buggy, they might get careless when you most need an advantage. We could always scoop you out of the air, you know.""

""What’re my chances on this one, Stet?""

Stetson shrugged. ""I’m afraid they’re slim. These goons probably have the _Delphinus_, and they want you just long enough to get your equipment and everything you know.""

""Rough as that, eh?""

""According to our best guess. If you’re not out in five days, we blast.""

Orne cleared his throat.

""Want out?"" asked Stetson.

""No.""

""Use the _back-door_ rule, son. Always leave yourself a way out. Now ... let’s check that equipment the surgeons put in your neck."" Stetson put a hand to his throat. His mouth remained closed, but there was a surf-hissing voice in Orne’s ears: ""You read me?""

""Sure. I can—""

""No!"" hissed the voice. ""Touch the mike contact. Keep your mouth closed. Just use your speaking muscles without speaking.""

Orne obeyed.

""Okay,"" said Stetson. ""You come in loud and clear.""

""I ought to. I’m right on top of you!""

""There’ll be a relay ship over you all the time,"" said Stetson. ""Now ... when you’re not touching that mike contact this rig’ll still feed us what you say ... and everything that goes on around you, too. We’ll monitor everything. Got that?""

""Yes.""

Stetson held out his right hand. ""Good luck. I meant that about diving in for you. Just say the word.""

""I know the word, too,"" said Orne. ""HELP!""

Gray mud floor and gloomy aisles between huge bluish tree trunks—that was the jungle. Only the faintest weak glimmering of sunlight pierced to the mud. The disguised sled—its para-grav units turned off—lurched and skidded around buttress roots. Its headlights swung in wild arcs across the trunks and down to the mud. Aerial creepers—great looping vines of them—swung down from the towering forest ceiling. A steady drip of condensation spattered the windshield, forcing Orne to use the wipers.

In the bucket seat of the sled’s cab, Orne struggled with the controls. He was plagued by the vague slow-motion-floating sensation that a heavy planet native always feels in lighter gravity. It gave him an unhappy stomach.

Things skipped through the air around the lurching vehicle: flitting and darting things. Insects came in twin cones, siphoned toward the headlights. There was an endless chittering whistling tok-tok-toking in the gloom beyond the lights.

Stetson’s voice hissed suddenly through the surgically implanted speaker: ""How’s it look?""

""Alien.""

""Any sign of that mob?""

""Negative.""

""Okay. We’re taking off.""

Behind Orne, there came a deep rumbling roar that receded as the scout cruiser climbed its jets. All other sounds hung suspended in after-silence, then resumed: the strongest first and then the weakest.

A heavy object suddenly arced through the headlights, swinging on a vine. It disappeared behind a tree. Another. Another. Ghostly shadows with vine pendulums on both sides. Something banged down heavily onto the hood of the sled.

Orne braked to a creaking stop that shifted the load behind him, found himself staring through the windshield at a native of Gienah III. The native crouched on the hood, a Mark XX exploding-pellet rifle in his right hand aimed at Orne’s head. In the sudden shock of meeting, Orne recognized the weapon: standard issue to the marine guards on all R&R survey ships.

The native appeared the twin of the one Orne had seen on the screen. The four-fingered hand looked extremely capable around the stock of the Mark XX.

Slowly, Orne put a hand to his throat, pressed the contact button. He moved his speaking muscles: ""Just made contact with the mob. One on the hood now has one of our Mark XX rifles aimed at my head.""

The surf-hissing of Stetson’s voice came through the hidden speaker: ""Want us to come back?""

""Negative. Stand by. He looks cautious rather than hostile.""

Orne held up his right hand, palm out. He had a second thought: held up his left hand, too. Universal symbol of peaceful intentions: empty hands. The gun muzzle lowered slightly. Orne called into his mind the language that had been hypnoforced into him. _Ocheero? No. That means ‘The People.’ Ah ..._ And he had the heavy fricative greeting sound.

""Ffroiragrazzi,"" he said.

The native shifted to the left, answered in pure, unaccented High Galactese: ""Who are you?""

Orne fought down a sudden panic. The lipless mouth had looked so odd forming the familiar words.

Stetson’s voice hissed: ""Is that the native speaking Galactese?""

Orne touched his throat. ""You heard him.""

He dropped his hand, said: ""I am Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and Reeducation. I was sent here at the request of the First-Contact officer on the _Delphinus Rediscovery_.""

""Where is your ship?"" demanded the Gienahn.

""It put me down and left.""

""Why?""

""It was behind schedule for another appointment.""

Out of the corners of his eyes, Orne saw more shadows dropping to the mud around him. The sled shifted as someone climbed onto the load behind the cab. The someone scuttled agilely for a moment.

The native climbed down to the cab’s side step, opened the door. The rifle was held at the ready. Again, the lipless mouth formed Galactese words: ""What do you carry in this ... vehicle?""

""The equipment every R&R field man uses to help the people of a rediscovered planet improve themselves."" Orne nodded at the rifle. ""Would you mind pointing that weapon some other direction? It makes me nervous.""

The gun muzzle remained unwaveringly on Orne’s middle. The native’s mouth opened, revealing long canines. ""Do we not look strange to you?""

""I take it there’s been a heavy mutational variation in the humanoid norm on this planet,"" said Orne. ""What is it? Hard radiation?""

No answer.

""It doesn’t really make any difference, of course,"" said Orne. ""I’m here to help you.""

""I am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,"" said the native. ""I decide who is to help.""

Orne swallowed.

""Where do you go?"" demanded Tanub.

""I was hoping to go to your city. Is it permitted?""

A long pause while the vertical-slit pupils of Tanub’s eyes expanded and contracted. ""It is permitted.""

Stetson’s voice came through the hidden speaker: ""All bets off. We’re coming in after you. That Mark XX is the final straw. It means they have the _Delphinus_ for sure!""

Orne touched his throat. ""No! Give me a little more time!""

""Why?""

""I have a hunch about these creatures.""

""What is it?""

""No time now. Trust me.""

Another long pause in which Orne and Tanub continued to study each other. Presently, Stetson said: ""Okay. Go ahead as planned. But find out where the _Delphinus_ is! If we get that back we pull their teeth.""

""Why do you keep touching your throat?"" demanded Tanub.

""I’m nervous,"" said Orne. ""Guns always make me nervous.""

The muzzle lowered slightly.

""Shall we continue on to your city?"" asked Orne. He wet his lips with his tongue. The cab light on Tanub’s face was giving the Gienahn an eerie sinister look.

""We can go soon,"" said Tanub.

""Will you join me inside here?"" asked Orne. ""There’s a passenger seat right behind me.""

Tanub’s eyes moved catlike: right, left. ""Yes."" He turned, barked an order into the jungle gloom, then climbed in behind Orne.

""When do we go?"" asked Orne.

""The great sun will be down soon,"" said Tanub. ""We can continue as soon as Chiranachuruso rises.""

""Chiranachuruso?""

""Our satellite ... our moon,"" said Tanub.

""It’s a beautiful word,"" said Orne. ""Chiranachuruso.""

""In our tongue it means: The Limb of Victory,"" said Tanub. ""By its light we will continue.""

Orne turned, looked back at Tanub. ""Do you mean to tell me that you can see by what light gets down here through those trees?""

""Can you not see?"" asked Tanub.

""Not without the headlights.""

""Our eyes differ,"" said Tanub. He bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical slit pupils of his eyes expanded, contracted. ""You are the same as the ... others.""

""Oh, on the _Delphinus_?""

Pause. ""Yes.""

Presently, a greater gloom came over the jungle, bringing a sudden stillness to the wild life. There was a chittering commotion from the natives in the trees around the sled. Tanub shifted behind Orne.

""We may go now,"" he said. ""Slowly ... to stay behind my ... scouts.""

""Right."" Orne eased the sled forward around an obstructing root.

Silence while they crawled ahead. Around them shapes flung themselves from vine to vine.

""I admired your city from the air,"" said Orne. ""It is very beautiful.""

""Yes,"" said Tanub. ""Why did you land so far from it?""

""We didn’t want to come down where we might destroy anything.""

""There is nothing to destroy in the jungle,"" said Tanub.

""Why do you have such a big city?"" asked Orne.

Silence.

""I said: Why do you—""

""You are ignorant of our ways,"" said Tanub. ""Therefore, I forgive you. The city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight. Once—long ago—we used crude platforms on the tops of the trees. Now ... only the ... wild ones do this.""

Stetson’s voice hissed in Orne’s ears: ""Easy on the sex line, boy. That’s always touchy. These creatures are oviparous. Sex glands are apparently hidden in that long fur behind where their chins ought to be.""

""Who controls the breeding sites controls our world,"" said Tanub. ""Once there was another city. We destroyed it.""

""Are there many ... wild ones?"" asked Orne.

""Fewer each year,"" said Tanub.

""There’s how they get their slaves,"" hissed Stetson.

""You speak excellent Galactese,"" said Orne.

""The High Path Chief commanded the best teacher,"" said Tanub. ""Do you, too, know many things, Orne?""

""That’s why I was sent here,"" said Orne.

""Are there many planets to teach?"" asked Tanub.

""Very many,"" said Orne. ""Your city—I saw very tall buildings. Of what do you build them?""

""In your tongue—glass,"" said Tanub. ""The engineers of the _Delphinus_ said it was impossible. As you saw—they are wrong.""

""A glass-blowing culture,"" hissed Stetson. ""That’d explain a lot of things.""

Slowly, the disguised sled crept through the jungle. Once, a scout swooped down into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped on Tanub’s order, and they waited almost ten minutes before proceeding.

""Wild ones?"" asked Orne.

""Perhaps,"" said Tanub.

A glowing of many lights grew visible through the giant tree trunks. It grew brighter as the sled crept through the last of the jungle, emerged in cleared land at the edge of the city.

Orne stared upward in awe. The city fluted and spiraled into the moonlit sky. It was a fragile appearing lacery of bridges, winking dots of light. The bridges wove back and forth from building to building until the entire visible network appeared one gigantic dew-glittering web.

""All that with glass,"" murmured Orne.

""What’s happening?"" hissed Stetson.

Orne touched his throat contact. ""We’re just into the city clearing, proceeding toward the nearest building.""

""This is far enough,"" said Tanub.

Orne stopped the sled. In the moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns all around. The buttressed pedestal of one of the buildings loomed directly ahead. It looked taller than had the scout cruiser in its jungle landing circle.

Tanub leaned close to Orne’s shoulder. ""We have not deceived you, have we, Orne?""

""Huh? What do you mean?""

""You have recognized that we are not mutated members of your race.""

Orne swallowed. Into his ears came Stetson’s voice: ""Better admit it.""

""That’s true,"" said Orne.

""I like you, Orne,"" said Tanub. ""You shall be one of my slaves. You will teach me many things.""

""How did you capture the _Delphinus_?"" asked Orne.

""You know that, too?""

""You have one of their rifles,"" said Orne.

""Your race is no match for us, Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in the prowess of the mind. Your ship landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior ceramics in those tubes.""

Orne turned, looked at Tanub in the dim glow of the cab light. ""Have you heard about the I-A, Tanub?""

""I-A? What is that?"" There was a wary tenseness in the Gienahn’s figure. His mouth opened to reveal the long canines.

""You took the _Delphinus_ by treachery?"" asked Orne.

""They were simple fools,"" said Tanub. ""We are smaller, thus they thought us weaker."" The Mark XX’s muzzle came around to center on Orne’s stomach. ""You have not answered my question. What is the I-A?""

""I am of the I-A,"" said Orne. ""Where’ve you hidden the _Delphinus_?""

""In the place that suits us best,"" said Tanub. ""In all our history there has never been a better place.""

""What do you plan to do with it?"" asked Orne.

""Within a year we will have a copy with our own improvements. After that—""

""You intend to start a war?"" asked Orne.

""In the jungle the strong slay the weak until only the strong remain,"" said Tanub.

""And then the strong prey upon each other?"" asked Orne.

""That is a quibble for women,"" said Tanub.

""It’s too bad you feel that way,"" said Orne. ""When two cultures meet like this they tend to help each other. What have you done with the crew of the _Delphinus_?""

""They are slaves,"" said Tanub. ""Those who still live. Some resisted. Others objected to teaching us what we want to know."" He waved the gun muzzle. ""You will not be that foolish, will you, Orne?""

""No need to be,"" said Orne. ""I’ve another little lesson to teach you: I already know where you’ve hidden the _Delphinus_.""

""Go, boy!"" hissed Stetson. ""Where is it?""

""Impossible!"" barked Tanub.

""It’s on your moon,"" said Orne. ""Darkside. It’s on a mountain on the darkside of your moon.""

Tanub’s eyes dilated, contracted. ""You read minds?""

""The I-A has no need to read minds,"" said Orne. ""We rely on superior mental prowess.""

""The marines are on their way,"" hissed Stetson. ""We’re coming in to get you. I’m going to want to know how you guessed that one.""

""You are a weak fool like the others,"" gritted Tanub.

""It’s too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low grades of the R&R,"" said Orne.

""Easy, boy,"" hissed Stetson. ""Don’t pick a fight with him now. Remember, his race is arboreal. He’s probably as strong as an ape.""

""I could kill you where you sit!"" grated Tanub.

""You write finish for your entire planet if you do,"" said Orne. ""I’m not alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There’s a ship overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with molten rock. It’d run like the glass you use for your buildings.""

""You are lying!""

""We’ll make you an offer,"" said Orne. ""We don’t really want to exterminate you. We’ll give you limited membership in the Galactic Federation until you prove you’re no menace to us.""

""Keep talking,"" hissed Stetson. ""Keep him interested.""

""You dare insult me!"" growled Tanub.

""You had better believe me,"" said Orne. ""We—""

Stetson’s voice interrupted him: ""Got it, Orne! They caught the _Delphinus_ on the ground right where you said it’d be! Blew the tubes off it. Marines now mopping up.""

""It’s like this,"" said Orne. ""We already have recaptured the _Delphinus_."" Tanub’s eyes went instinctively skyward. ""Except for the captured armament you still hold, you obviously don’t have the weapons to meet us,"" continued Orne. ""Otherwise, you wouldn’t be carrying that rifle off the _Delphinus_.""

""If you speak the truth, then we shall die bravely,"" said Tanub.

""No need for you to die,"" said Orne.

""Better to die than be slaves,"" said Tanub.

""We don’t need slaves,"" said Orne. ""We—""

""I cannot take the chance that you are lying,"" said Tanub. ""I must kill you now.""

Orne’s foot rested on the air sled control pedal. He depressed it. Instantly, the sled shot skyward, heavy G’s pressing them down into the seats. The gun in Tanub’s hands was slammed into his lap. He struggled to raise it. To Orne, the weight was still only about twice that of his home planet of Chargon. He reached over, took the rifle, found safety belts, bound Tanub with them. Then he eased off the acceleration.

""We don’t need slaves,"" said Orne. ""We have machines to do our work. We’ll send experts in here, teach you people how to exploit your planet, how to build good transportation facilities, show you how to mine your minerals, how to—""

""And what do we do in return?"" whispered Tanub.

""You could start by teaching us how you make superior glass,"" said Orne. ""I certainly hope you see things our way. We really don’t want to have to come down there and clean you out. It’d be a shame to have to blast that city into little pieces.""

Tanub wilted. Presently, he said: ""Send me back. I will discuss this with ... our council."" He stared at Orne. ""You I-A’s are too strong. We did not know.""

In the wardroom of Stetson’s scout cruiser, the lights were low, the leather chairs comfortable, the green beige table set with a decanter of Hochar brandy and two glasses.

Orne lifted his glass, sipped the liquor, smacked his lips. ""For a while there, I thought I’d never be tasting anything like this again.""

Stetson took his own glass. ""ComGO heard the whole thing over the general monitor net,"" he said. ""D’you know you’ve been breveted to senior field man?""

""Ah, they’ve already recognized my sterling worth,"" said Orne.

The wolfish grin took over Stetson’s big features. ""Senior field men last about half as long as the juniors,"" he said. ""Mortality’s terrific?""

""I might’ve known,"" said Orne. He took another sip of the brandy.

Stetson flicked on the switch of a recorder beside him. ""Okay. You can go ahead any time.""

""Where do you want me to start?""

""First, how’d you spot right away where they’d hidden the _Delphinus_?""

""Easy. Tanub’s word for his people was _Grazzi_. Most races call themselves something meaning _The People_. But in his tongue that’s _Ocheero_. _Grazzi_ wasn’t on the translated list. I started working on it. The most likely answer was that it had been adopted from another language, and meant _enemy_.""

""And _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?""

""No. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I’d kind of felt from the first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the Indians of ancient Terra.""

""Why?""

""They came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right onto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you see?""

""I guess so.""

""Then he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn’t on the language list, either. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There’s a word in almost every language in history that means raider and derives from a word for road, path or highway.""

""Highwaymen,"" said Stetson.

""Raid itself,"" said Orne. ""An ancient Terran language corruption of road.""

""Yeah, yeah. But where’d all this translation stuff put—""

""Don’t be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon was _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it just fell into place.""

""How?""

""The vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?""

""Maybe. What’s it mean to you?""

""Night-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from above. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And Tanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in all of their history. History? That’d be a high place. Dark, likewise. Ergo: a high place on the darkside of their moon.""

""I’m a pie-eyed greepus,"" whispered Stetson.

Orne grinned, said: ""You probably are ... sir.""

THE END",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in Frank Herbert's ""Missing Link"" revolves around the tension between discovery and destruction. The protagonist, Lewis Orne, is sent on a mission to a newly discovered alien planet, Gienah III, with the directive to determine whether the alien inhabitants are a threat to human civilization. The dilemma faced by Orne and the Investigation & Adjustment (I-A) team is whether to wipe out the alien civilization, as they appear to have captured a human survey ship, the Delphinus, or to attempt peaceful contact and integration. This conflict is further complicated by the time pressure imposed by political forces, which dictate a planet-buster bomb will be deployed in five days if Orne cannot secure a peaceful resolution.

The story explores themes of cultural misunderstanding, the dangers of assumptions, and the potential benefits and threats of encountering an alien civilization. Orne's mission is to uncover the truth about the aliens' intentions and capabilities, balancing the need for security with the hope for peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit. His challenge is to navigate the complexities of first contact, using his skills and intuition to avoid unnecessary destruction while uncovering the fate of the Delphinus and its crew.","Would you risk everything to save an alien world, knowing a bomb will destroy it in five days?","You're sent to a jungle planet. If you don't find the lost crew soon, the whole place gets nuked. What do you do?","You're the only one who can stop a planet from being destroyed. But first, you must solve an alien mystery."

No self-respecting artist can object to suffering for his art... but not in a society where art is outdated by technology!

I

Halvorsen was waiting in the Chancery office while Monsignor Reedy finished up with a few people ahead of him. He was feeling hungry and a bit dizzy. He barely noticed when the prelate's secretary gestured for him to come in. As he got up, he realized he'd left his portfolio against his chair and had to go back for it, feeling embarrassed. The secretary was patient.

""Thanks,"" Halvorsen muttered as the door closed behind him.

Something seemed off about the monsignor's manner.

""I've brought the designs for the Stations, Padre,"" Halvorsen said, opening his portfolio on the desk.

""Bad news, Roald,"" the monsignor said. ""I know you were looking forward to this commission—""

""Did someone else get it?"" Halvorsen asked weakly, leaning against the desk. ""I thought it was decided I had it—""

""It's not that,"" the monsignor explained. ""The Sacred Congregation of Rites made a decision this week about devotional images. They said stereopantograph is allowed within a diocese if the bishop agrees. And his eminence—""

""S.P.G.—fake stuff,"" Halvorsen protested. ""It's as real as a plastic eye. No texture. No soul. You know that, Padre!"" he said accusingly.

""I'm sorry, Roald,"" the monsignor replied. ""Your work is better than what we'll get from a stereopantograph—at least to my eyes. But there are other things to consider.""

""Money!"" spat the artist.

""Yes, money,"" the prelate admitted. ""His eminence wants to see the St. Xavier U. building program through before he dies. Is that so wrong? And we have our schools, our charities, our mission to Venus. S.P.G. saves a lot on buying and maintaining devotional images. Even if I could, I wouldn't disagree with his eminence on making it diocesan policy.""

The monsignor's eyes lingered on the detailed drawings of the Stations of the Cross.

""Your St. Veronica,"" he said thoughtfully. ""Very fine. It reminds me of one of Caravaggio's care-worn saints. I would have liked to see her in bronze.""

""So would I,"" Halvorsen said hoarsely. ""Keep the drawings, Padre."" He headed for the door.

""But I can't—""

""It's all right.""

Halvorsen walked past the secretary and out into the sunshine of Fifth Avenue. He hoped Monsignor Reedy was appreciating the drawings, and he felt ashamed of himself and sorry for Halvorsen. He was glad he didn't have to carry the heavy portfolio anymore. Everything seemed so heavy lately—chisels, hammer, wooden palette. Maybe the padre would send him something and pretend it was for expenses or an advance, as he had done before.

Halvorsen's feet carried him up the Avenue. No, there wouldn't be any more advances. The last steady trickle of income had dried up, thanks to an announcement in Osservatore Romano. The Church's conservative nature had taken art patronage as far as it would go.

When all Europe moved to vellum, the Church stuck with papyrus. When all Europe switched to paper, the Church stayed with vellum. When architects and committees turned to stereopantograph, the Church stuck with expensive sculpture. But no more.

He was passing an S.P.G. salon now, where one of his Tuesday night students worked: one of the few men in the class. Mostly, the classes were filled with lazy, moody, irritable girls. Halvorsen, surprised at himself, went inside the salon, walking among the plastic statues that made his skin prickle.

""Slime!"" he thought. ""How can they—""

""May I help—oh, hello, Roald. What brings you here?""

He suddenly knew what had brought him there. ""Could you make a little advance on next month's tuition, Lewis? I'm strapped."" He avoided looking at the man's condescending face.

""I guess so, Roald. Would ten dollars help? That'll carry us through to the 25th, right?""

""Fine, right, sure,"" he said, while being reluctantly shown around the place.

""I know you don't think much of S.P.G., but it's quiet now, so it's a good chance to see how we work. I don't say it's Art with a capital A, but you've got to admit it's an art, something people like at a price they can afford. Here's where we sit them. Then you run out the feelers to the reference points on the face. You know what they are?""

""I know what they are,"" Halvorsen said dryly. ""The Egyptian sculptors used them for statues of pharaohs.""

""Yes? I never knew that. There's nothing new under the Sun, is there? But this is the heart of the S.P.G."" The young man proudly showed off an electronic device. Tubes winked at Halvorsen.

""The esthetikon?"" he asked indifferently. He didn't feel indifferent, but it would be silly to get angry with a mindless machine that could design, criticize, and correct images—and had put designers out of work.

""Yes. The lenses take sixteen profiles, and we set the esthetikon for what we want—cute, rugged, sexy, spiritual, brainy, or a mix. It connects the curves from profile to profile to give us what we want, changes the profiles if needed, and there's your portrait stored and ready to be taped. You set your size and play it back. I wish we were making one today; it's fascinating to watch. You pour in your cold-set plastic, the nozzles ooze out a core and start scanning—a drop here, a thread there, and it begins to take shape.

""We mostly do portrait busts here, the Avenue trade, but Wilgus, the foreman, used to work in a monument shop in Brooklyn. He did that heroic-size war memorial on the East River Drive—hired Garda Bouchette, the TV girl, for the central figure. And what a figure! He told me he set the esthetikon plates for three-quarters sexy, one-quarter spiritual. Here's something interesting—a standing figurine of Orin Ryerson, the banker. He ordered twelve. Figurines are coming in. The girls like them because they can show their shapes. You'd be surprised at some of the poses they want to try—""

Somehow, Halvorsen got out with the ten dollars, walked to Sixth Avenue, and sat down hard in a cheap restaurant. He had coffee and dozed a little, waking with a guilty start at the noise from across the street. A building was going up. For a while, he watched the machines pour walls and floors, the workers rolling here and there on their little vehicles to weld a wall panel, stripe on an electric circuit of conductive ink, or spray plastic finish over the ""wired"" wall, all without leaving their little vehicles.

Halvorsen felt more determined. He bought a paper from a vending machine by the restaurant door, got another cup of coffee, and turned to the help-wanted ads.

The trade-school ads urged him to learn construction work and make big money. Be a plumbing-machine setup man. Be a house-wiring machine tender. Be a servotruck driver. Be a lumber-stacker operator. Learn pouring-machine maintenance.

Make big money!

He panicked a little. He ran to the phone booth and dialed a Passaic number. He heard the ring and strained to hear old Mr. Krehbeil's footsteps getting closer to the phone, even though he knew he wouldn't hear anything until the receiver was picked up.

Ring—ring—ring. ""Hello?"" grunted the old man's voice, and his face appeared on the small screen. ""Hello, Mr. Halvorsen. What can I do for you?""

Halvorsen was tongue-tied. He couldn't say: I just wanted to see if you were still there. I was afraid you weren't there anymore. He choked and improvised: ""Hello, Mr. Krehbeil. It's about the banister on the stairs at my place. I noticed it's pretty shaky. Could you come over sometime and fix it for me?""

Krehbeil peered suspiciously out of the screen. ""I could do that,"" he said slowly. ""I don't have much work nowadays. But you can carpenter as well as I can, Mr. Halvorsen, and frankly, you're very slow pay and I like cabinet work better. I'm not a young man and climbing around on ladders takes it out of me. If you can't find anybody else, I'll take the work, but I need some of the money first, just for the materials. It's not easy to get good wood anymore.""

""All right,"" said Halvorsen. ""Thanks, Mr. Krehbeil. I'll call you if I can't get anybody else.""

He hung up and went back to his table and newspaper. His face burned with anger at the old man's reluctance and his own foolish panic. Krehbeil didn't realize they were both in the same leaky boat. Krehbeil, who didn't get a job in a month, still thought with senile pride that he was a journeyman carpenter and cabinetmaker who could make his solid way anywhere with his toolbox and his skill, and that he could look down on anything as disreputable as an artist—even an artist who could carpenter as well as he did himself.

Labuerre had made Halvorsen learn carpentry, and Labuerre had been right. You build a scaffold so you can sculpt up high, not so it will collapse and break a leg. You build your platforms so they hold the rock steady, not so it wobbles and chatters at every blow of the chisel. You build your armatures so they hold the plasticine you slam onto them.

But the help-wanted ads wanted no builders of scaffolds, platforms, and armatures. The factories were calling for setup men and maintenance men for the production and assembly machines.

From upstate, General Vegetables had sent a recruiting team for farm help—harvest setup and maintenance men, a few openings for experienced operators of tank-caulking machinery. Under ""office and professional,"" there was a heavy demand for computer men, for girls who could run the I.B.M. Letteriter, especially familiar with sales and collections correspondence, for office machinery maintenance and repair men. A job printing house wanted an esthetikon operator for letterhead layouts and the like. A.T. & T. wanted trainees to earn while learning telephone maintenance. A direct-mail advertising outfit wanted an artist—no, they wanted a sales-executive who could scrawl picture-ideas that would be subjected to the criticism and correction of the esthetikon.

Halvorsen leafed tiredly through the rest of the paper. He knew he wouldn't get a job, and if he did, he wouldn't hold it. He knew it was a terrible thing to admit to yourself that you might starve to death because you were bored by anything except art, but he admitted it.

It had happened often enough in the past—artists undergoing preposterous hardships, not, as people thought, because they were devoted to art, but because nothing else was interesting. If there were only some impressive, sonorous word that summed up the aching, oppressive futility that overcame him when he tried to get out of art—only there wasn't.

He thought he could tell which of the photos in the tabloid had been corrected by the esthetikon.

There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, who was to star in a remake of Peter Pan. Her ears had been made to look not pointed but pointy, her upper lip had been lengthened a bit, her nose had been pugged a little and tilted quite a lot, her freckles were cuter than cute, her brows were innocently arched, and her lower lip and eyes were nothing less than pornography.

There was a shot, apparently uncorrected, of the last Venus ship coming in at La Guardia and the average-looking explorers grinning. Caption: ""Austin Malone and crew smile relief on safe arrival. Malone says Venus colonies need men, machines. See story p. 2.""

Petulantly, Halvorsen threw the paper under the table and walked out. What had space travel to do with him? Vacations on the Moon and expeditions to Venus and Mars were part of the deadly encroachment on his livelihood and no more.

II

He took the subway to Passaic and walked down a long-still traffic beltway to his studio, almost the only building alive in the slums near the rusting railroad freightyard.

A sign that had once said ""F. Labuerre, Sculptor—Portraits and Architectural Commissions"" now said ""Roald Halvorsen; Art Classes—Reasonable Fees."" It was a grimy two-story frame building with a shopfront in which were mounted some of his students' charcoal figure studies and oil still-lifes. He lived upstairs, taught downstairs front, and did his own work downstairs, back behind dirty, ceiling-high drapes.

Going in, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock the door again. He slammed it bitterly. At the noise, somebody called from behind the drapes: ""Who's that?""

""Halvorsen!"" he yelled in a sudden fury. ""I live here. I own this place. Come out of there! What do you want?""

There was a fumbling at the drapes and a girl stepped between them, shrinking from their dirt.

""Your door was open,"" she said firmly, ""and it's a shop. I've just been here a couple of minutes. I came to ask about classes, but I don't think I'm interested if you're this bad-tempered.""

A pupil. Pupils were never to be abused, especially not now.

""I'm terribly sorry,"" he said. ""I had a trying day in the city."" Now turn it on. ""I wouldn't tell everybody a terrible secret like this, but I've lost a commission. You understand? I thought so. Anybody who'd traipse out here to my dingy abode would be simpatica. Won't you sit down? No, not there—humor an artist and sit over there. The warm background of that still-life brings out your color—quite good color. Have you ever been painted? You've a very interesting face, you know. Someday I'd like to—but you mentioned classes.

""We have figure classes, male and female models alternating, on Tuesday nights. For that I have to be very stern and ask you to sign up for an entire course of twelve lessons at sixty dollars. It's the models' fees—they're exorbitant. Saturday afternoons we have still-life classes for beginners in oils. That's only two dollars a class, but you might sign up for a series of six and pay ten dollars in advance, which saves you two whole dollars. I also give private instructions to a few talented amateurs.""

The price was open on that one—whatever the traffic would bear. It had been a year since he'd had a private pupil and she'd taken only six lessons at five dollars an hour.

""The still-life sounds interesting,"" said the girl, holding her head self-consciously the way they all did when he gave them the patter. It was a good head, carried well up. The muscles clung close, not yet slacked into loops and lumps. ""I saw some interesting things back there. Was that your own work?""

She rose, obviously with the expectation of being taken into the studio. Her body was one of those long-lined, small-breasted, coltish jobs that the pre-Raphaelites loved to draw.

""Well—"" said Halvorsen. A deliberate show of reluctance and then a bright smile of confidence. ""You'll understand,"" he said positively and drew aside the curtains.

""What a curious place!"" She wandered about, inspecting the drums of plaster, clay and plasticene, the racks of tools, the stands, the stones, the chisels, the forge, the kiln, the lumber, the glaze bench.

""I like this,"" she said determinedly, picking up a figure a half-meter tall, a Venus he had cast in bronze while studying under Labuerre some years ago. ""How much is it?""

An honest answer would scare her off, and there was no chance in the world that she'd buy. ""I hardly ever put my things up for sale,"" he told her lightly. ""That was just a little study. I do work on commission only nowadays.""

Her eyes flicked about the dingy room, seeming to take in its scaling plaster and warped floor and see through the wall to the abandoned slum in which it was set. There was amusement in her glance.

I am not being honest, she thinks. She thinks that is funny. Very well, I will be honest. ""Six hundred dollars,"" he said flatly.

The girl set the figurine on its stand with a rap and said, half angry and half amused: ""I don't understand it. That's more than a month's pay for me. I could get an S.P.G. statuette just as pretty as this for ten dollars. Who do you artists think you are, anyway?""

Halvorsen debated with himself about what he could say in reply:

An S.P.G. operator spends a week learning his skill and I spend a lifetime learning mine.

An S.P.G. operator makes a mechanical copy of a human form distorted by formulae mechanically arrived at from psychotests of population samples. I take full responsibility for my work; it is mine, though I use what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Augustan and Romantic and Modern Eras.

An S.P.G. operator works in soft, homogeneous plastic; I work in bronze that is more complicated than you dream, that is cast and acid-dipped today so it will slowly take on rich and subtle coloring many years from today.

An S.P.G. operator could not make an Orpheus Fountain—

He mumbled, ""Orpheus,"" and keeled over.

Halvorsen awoke in his bed on the second floor of the building. His fingers and toes buzzed electrically and he felt very clear-headed. The girl and a man, unmistakably a doctor, were watching him.

""You don't seem to belong to any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,"" the doctor said irritably. ""There weren't any cards on you at all. No Red, no Blue, no Green, no Brown.""

""I used to be on the Green Plan, but I let it lapse,"" the artist said defensively.

""And look what happened!""

""Stop nagging him!"" the girl said. ""I'll pay you your fee.""

""It's supposed to come through a Plan,"" the doctor fretted.

""We won't tell anybody,"" the girl promised. ""Here's five dollars. Just stop nagging him.""

""Malnutrition,"" said the doctor. ""Normally I'd send him to a hospital, but I don't see how I could manage it. He isn't on any Plan at all. Look, I'll take the money and leave some vitamins. That's what he needs—vitamins. And food.""

""I'll see that he eats,"" the girl said, and the doctor left.

""How long since you've had anything?"" she asked Halvorsen.

""I had some coffee today,"" he answered, thinking back. ""I'd been working on detail drawings for a commission and it fell through. I told you that. It was a shock.""

""I'm Lucretia Grumman,"" she said, and went out.

He dozed until she came back with an armful of groceries.

""It's hard to get around down here,"" she complained.

""It was Labuerre's studio,"" he told her defiantly. ""He left it to me when he died. Things weren't so rundown in his time. I studied under him; he was one of the last. He had a joke—'They don't really want my stuff, but they're ashamed to let me starve.' He warned me that they wouldn't be ashamed to let me starve, but I insisted and he took me in.""

Halvorsen drank some milk and ate some bread. He thought of the change from the ten dollars in his pocket and decided not to mention it. Then he remembered that the doctor had gone through his pockets.

""I can pay you for this,"" he said. ""It's very kind of you, but you mustn't think I'm penniless. I've just been too preoccupied to take care of myself.""

""Sure,"" said the girl. ""But we can call this an advance. I want to sign up for some classes.""

""Be happy to have you.""

""Am I bothering you?"" asked the girl. ""You said something odd when you fainted—'Orpheus.'""

""Did I say that? I must have been thinking of Milles' Orpheus Fountain in Copenhagen. I've seen photos, but I've never been there.""

""Germany? But there's nothing left of Germany.""

""Copenhagen's in Denmark. There's quite a lot of Denmark left. It was only on the fringes. Heavily radiated, but still there.""

""I want to travel, too,"" she said. ""I work at La Guardia and I've never been off, except for an orbiting excursion. I want to go to the Moon on my vacation. They give us a bonus in travel vouchers. It must be wonderful dancing under the low gravity.""

Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? Terms belonging to the detested electronic world of the stereopantograph in which he had no place.

""Be very interesting,"" he said, closing his eyes to conceal disgust.

""I am bothering you. I'll go away now, but I'll be back Tuesday night for the class. What time do I come and what should I bring?""

""Eight. It's charcoal—I sell you the sticks and paper. Just bring a smock.""

""All right. And I want to take the oils class, too. And I want to bring some people I know to see your work. I'm sure they'll see something they like. Austin Malone's in from Venus—he's a special friend of mine.""

""Lucretia,"" he said. ""Or do some people call you Lucy?""

""Lucy.""

""Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?""

""I can't do that!""

""Please. I'd feel much better about this. I really mean it.""

She nodded abruptly, flushing, and almost ran from the room.

Now why did I do that? he asked himself. He hoped it was because he liked Lucy Grumman very much. He hoped it wasn't a cold-blooded investment of a piece of sculpture that would never be sold, anyway, just to make sure she'd be back with class fees and more groceries.

III

She was back on Tuesday, a half-hour early and carrying a smock. He introduced her formally to the others as they arrived: a dozen or so bored young women who, he suspected, talked a great deal about their art lessons outside, but in class used any excuse to stop sketching.

He didn't dare show Lucy any particular consideration. There were fierce little cliques in the class. Halvorsen knew they laughed at him and his line among themselves, and yet, strangely, were fiercely jealous of their seniority and right to individual attention.

The lesson was an ordeal, as usual. The model, a muscle-bound young graduate of the barbell gyms and figure-photography studios, was stupid and argumentative about ten-minute poses. Two of the girls came near a hair-pulling brawl over the rights to a preferred sketching location. A third girl had discovered Picasso's cubist period during the past week and proudly announced that she didn't feel perspective in art.

But the two interminable hours finally ticked by. He nagged them into cleaning up—not as bad as the Saturdays with oils—and stood by the open door. Otherwise they would have stayed all night, cackling about absent students and snarling sulkily among themselves. His well-laid plans went sour, though. A large and flashy car drove up as the girls were leaving.

""That's Austin Malone,"" said Lucy. ""He came to pick me up and look at your work.""

That was all the wedge her fellow-pupils needed.

""Austin Malone! Well!""

""Lucy, darling, I'd love to meet a real spaceman.""

""Roald, darling, would you mind very much if I stayed a moment?""

""I'm certainly not going to miss this and I don't care if you mind or not, Roald, darling!""

Malone was an impressive figure. Halvorsen thought: he looks as though he's been run through an esthetikon set for 'brawny' and 'determined.' Lucy made a hash of the introductions and the spaceman didn't rise to conversational bait dangled enticingly by the girls.

In a clear voice, he said to Halvorsen: ""I don't want to take up too much of your time. Lucy tells me you have some things for sale. Is there any place we can look at them where it's quiet?""

The students made sulky exits.

""Back here,"" said the artist.

The girl and Malone followed him through the curtains. The spaceman made a slow circuit of the studio, seeming to repel questions.

He sat down at last and said: ""I don't know what to think, Halvorsen. This place stuns me. Do you know you're in the Dark Ages?""

People who never have given a thought to Chartres and Mont St. Michel usually call it the Dark Ages, Halvorsen thought wryly. He asked, ""Technologically, you mean? No, not at all. My plaster's better, my colors are better, my metal is better—tool metal, not casting metal, that is.""

""I mean hand work,"" said the spaceman. ""Actually working by hand.""

The artist shrugged. ""There have been crazes for the techniques of the boiler works and the machine shop,"" he admitted. ""Some interesting things were done, but they didn't stand up well. Is there anything here that takes your eye?""

""I like those dolphins,"" said the spaceman, pointing to a perforated terra-cotta relief on the wall. They had been commissioned by an architect, then later refused for reasons of economy when the house had run way over estimate. ""They'd look great over the fireplace in my town apartment. Like them, Lucy?""

""I think they're wonderful,"" said the girl.

Roald saw the spaceman go rigid with the effort not to turn and stare at her. He loved her and he was jealous.

Roald told the story of the dolphins and said: ""The price that the architect thought was too high was three hundred and sixty dollars.""

Malone grunted. ""Doesn't seem unreasonable—if you set a high store on inspiration.""

""I don't know about inspiration,"" the artist said evenly. ""But I was awake for two days and two nights shoveling coal and adjusting drafts to fire that thing in my kiln.""

The spaceman looked contemptuous. ""I'll take it,"" he said. ""Be something to talk about during those awkward pauses. Tell me, Halvorsen, how's Lucy's work? Do you think she ought to stick with it?""

""Austin,"" objected the girl, ""don't be so blunt. How can he possibly know after one day?""

""She can't draw yet,"" the artist said cautiously. ""It's all coordination, you know—thousands of hours of practice, training your eye and hand to work together until you can put a line on paper where you want it. Lucy, if you're really interested in it, you'll learn to draw well. I don't think any of the other students will. They're in it because of boredom or snobbery, and they'll stop before they have their eye-hand coordination.""

""I am interested,"" she said firmly.

Malone's determined restraint broke. ""Damned right you are. In—"" He recovered himself and demanded of Halvorsen: ""I understand your point about coordination. But thousands of hours when you can buy a camera? It's absurd.""

""I was talking about drawing, not art,"" replied Halvorsen. ""Drawing is putting a line on paper where you want it, I said."" He took a deep breath and hoped the great distinction wouldn't sound silly and small. ""So let's say that art is knowing how to put the line in the right place.""

""Be practical. There isn't any art. Not any more. I get around quite a bit and I never see anything but photos and S.P.G.s. A few heirlooms, yes, but nobody's painting or carving any more.""

""There's some art, Malone. My students—a couple of them in the still-life class—are quite good. There are more across the country. Art for occupational therapy, or a hobby, or something to do with the hands. There's trade in their work. They sell them to each other, they give them to their friends, they hang them on their walls. There are even some sculptors like that. Sculpture is prescribed by doctors. The occupational therapists say it's even better than drawing and painting, so some of these people work in plasticene and soft stone, and some of them get to be good.""

""Maybe so. I'm an engineer, Halvorsen. We glory in doing things the easy way. Doing things the easy way got me to Mars and Venus and it's going to get me to Ganymede. You're doing things the hard way, and your inefficiency has no place in this world. Look at you! You've lost a fingertip—some accident, I suppose.""

""I never noticed—"" said Lucy, and then let out a faint, ""Oh!""

Halvorsen curled the middle finger of his left hand into the palm, where he usually carried it to hide the missing first joint.

""Yes,"" he said softly. ""An accident.""

""Accidents are a sign of inadequate mastery of material and equipment,"" said Malone sententiously. ""While you stick to your methods and I stick to mine, you can't compete with me.""

His tone made it clear that he was talking about more than engineering.

""Shall we go now, Lucy? Here's my card, Halvorsen. Send those dolphins along and I'll mail you a check.""

IV

The artist walked the half-dozen blocks to Mr. Krehbeil's place the next day. He found the old man in the basement shop of his fussy house, hunched over his bench with a powerful light overhead. He was trying to file a saw.

""Mr. Krehbeil!"" Halvorsen called over the shriek of metal.

The carpenter turned around and peered with watery eyes. ""I can't see like I used to,"" he said querulously. ""I go over the same teeth on this damn saw, I skip teeth, I can't see the light shine off it when I got one set. The glare."" He banged down his three-cornered file petulantly. ""Well, what can I do for you?""

""I need some crating stock. Anything. I'll trade you a couple of my maple four-by-fours.""

The old face became cunning. ""And will you set my saw? My saws, I mean. It's nothing to you—an hour's work. You have the eyes.""

Halvorsen said bitterly, ""All right."" The old man had to drive his bargain, even though he might never use his saws again. And then the artist promptly repented of his bitterness, offering up a quick prayer that his own failure to conform didn't make him as much of a nuisance to the world as Krehbeil was.

The carpenter was pleased as they went through his small stock of wood and chose boards to crate the dolphin relief. He was pleased enough to give Halvorsen coffee and cake before the artist buckled down to filing the saws.

Over the kitchen table, Halvorsen tried to probe. ""Things pretty slow now?""

It would be hard to spoil Krehbeil's day now. ""People are always fools. They don't know good hand work. Some day,"" he said apocalyptically, ""I laugh on the other side of my face when their foolish machine-buildings go falling down in a strong wind, all of them, all over the country. Even my boy—I used to beat him good, almost every day—he works a foolish concrete machine and his house should fall on his head like the rest.""

Halvorsen knew it was Krehbeil's son who supported him by mail, and changed the subject. ""You get some cabinet work?""

""Stupid women! What they call antiques—they don't know Meissen, they don't know Biedermeier. They bring me trash to repair sometimes. I make them pay; I swindle them good.""

""I wonder if things would be different if there were anything left over in Europe....""

""People will still be fools, Mr. Halvorsen,"" said the carpenter positively. ""Didn't you say you were going to file those saws today?""

So the artist spent two noisy hours filing before he carried his crating stock to the studio.

Lucy was there. She had brought some things to eat. He dumped the lumber with a bang and demanded: ""Why aren't you at work?""

""We get days off,"" she said vaguely. ""Austin thought he'd give me the cash for the terra-cotta and I could give it to you.""

She held out an envelope while he studied her silently. The farce was beginning again. But this time he dreaded it.

It would not be the first time that a lonesome, discontented girl chose to see him as a combination of romantic rebel and lost pup, with the consequences you'd expect.

He knew from books, experience and Labuerre's conversation in the old days that there was nothing novel about the comedy—that there had even been artists, lots of them, who had counted on endless repetitions of it for their livelihood.

The girl drops in with groceries and the artist is pleasantly surprised; the girl admires this little thing or that after payday and buys it and the artist is pleasantly surprised; the girl brings her friends to take lessons or make little purchases and the artist is pleasantly surprised. The girl may be seduced by the artist or vice versa, which shortens the comedy, or they get married, which lengthens it somewhat.

It had been three years since Halvorsen had last played out the farce with a manic-depressive divorcee from Elmira: three years during which he had crossed the mid-point between thirty and forty; three more years to get beaten down by being unwanted and working too much and eating too little.

Also, he knew, he was in love with this girl.

He took the envelope, counted three hundred and twenty dollars and crammed it into his pocket. ""That was your idea,"" he said. ""Thanks. Now get out, will you? I've got work to do.""

She stood there, shocked.

""I said get out. I have work to do.""

""Austin was right,"" she told him miserably. ""You don't care how people feel. You just want to get things out of them.""

She ran from the studio, and Halvorsen fought with himself not to run after her.

He walked slowly into his workshop and studied his array of tools, though he paid little attention to his finished pieces. It would be nice to spend about half of this money on open-hearth steel rod and bar stock to forge into chisels; he thought he knew where he could get some—but she would be back, or he would break and go to her and be forgiven and the comedy would be played out, after all.

He couldn't let that happen.

V

Aalesund, on the Atlantic side of the Dourefeld mountains of Norway, was in the lee of the blasted continent. One more archeologist there made no difference, as long as he had the sense to recognize the propellor-like international signposts that said with their three blades, Radiation Hazard, and knew what every schoolboy knew about protective clothing and reading a personal Geiger counter.

The car Halvorsen rented was for a brief trip over the mountains to study contaminated Oslo. Well-muffled, he could make it and back in a dozen hours and no harm done.

But he took the car past Oslo, Wennersborg and Goteborg, along the Kattegat coast to Helsingborg, and abandoned it there, among the three-bladed polyglot signs, crossing to Denmark. Danes were as unlike Prussians as they could be, but their unfortunate little peninsula was a sprout off Prussia which radio-cobalt dust couldn't tell from the real thing. The three-bladed signs were most specific.

With a long way to walk along the rubble-littered highways, he stripped off the impregnated coveralls and boots. He had long since shed the noisy counter and the uncomfortable gloves and mask.

The silence was eerie as he limped into Copenhagen at noon. He didn't know whether the radiation was getting to him or whether he was tired and hungry and no more. As though thinking of a stranger, he liked what he was doing.

I'll be my own audience, he thought. God knows I learned there isn't any other, not any more. You have to know when to stop. Rodin, the dirty old, wonderful old man, knew that. He taught us not to slick it and polish it and smooth it until it looked like liquid instead of bronze and stone. Van Gogh was crazy as a loon, but he knew when to stop and varnish it, and he didn't care if the paint looked like paint instead of looking like sunset clouds or moonbeams. Up in Hartford, Browne and Sharpe stop when they've got a turret lathe; they don't put caryatids on it. I'll stop while my life is a life, before it becomes a thing with distracting embellishments such as a wife who will come to despise me, a succession of gradually less worthwhile pieces that nobody will look at.

Blame nobody, he told himself, lightheadedly.

And then it was in front of him, terminating a vista of weeds and bomb rubble—Milles' Orpheus Fountain.

It took a man, he thought. Esthetikon circuits couldn't do it. There was a gross mixture of styles, a calculated flaw that the esthetikon couldn't be set to make. Orpheus and the souls were classic or later; the three-headed dog was archaic. That was to tell you about the antiquity and invincibility of Hell, and that Cerberus knows Orpheus will never go back into life with his bride.

There was the heroic, tragic central figure that looked mighty enough to battle with the gods, but battle wasn't any good against the grinning, knowing, hateful three-headed dog it stood on. You don't battle the pavement where you walk or the floor of the house you're in; you can't. So Orpheus, his face a mask of controlled and suffering fury crashes a great chord from his lyre that moved trees and stones. Around him the naked souls in Hell start at the chord, each in its own way: the young lovers down in death; the mother down in death; the musician, deaf and down in death, straining to hear.

Halvorsen, walking uncertainly toward the fountain, felt something break inside him, and a heaviness in his lungs. As he pitched forward among the weeds, he thought he heard the chord from the lyre and didn't care that the three-headed dog was grinning its knowing, hateful grin down at him.

VI

When Halvorsen awoke, he supposed he was in Hell. There were the young lovers, arms about each other's waists, solemnly looking down at him, and the mother was placidly smoothing his brow. He stirred and felt his left arm fall heavily.

""Ah,"" said the mother, ""you mustn't."" He felt her pick up his limp arm and lay it across his chest. ""Your poor finger!"" she sighed. ""Can you talk? What happened to it?""

He could talk, weakly. ""Labuerre and I,"" he said. ""We were moving a big block of marble with the crane—somehow the finger got under it. I didn't notice until it was too late to shift my grip without the marble slipping and smashing on the floor.""

The boy said in a solemn, adolescent croak: ""You mean you saved the marble and lost your finger?""

""Marble,"" he muttered. ""It's so hard to get. Labuerre was so old.""

The young lovers exchanged a glance and he slept again. He was half awake when the musician seized first one of his hands and then the other, jabbing them with stubby fingers and bending his lion's head close to peer at the horny callouses left by chisel and mallet.

""Ja, ja,"" the musician kept saying.

Hell goes on forever, so for an eternity he jolted and jarred, and for an eternity he heard bickering voices: ""Why he was so foolish, then?"" ""A idiot he could be."" ""Hush, let him rest."" ""The children told the story."" ""There only one Labuerre was."" ""Easy with the tubing."" ""Let him rest.""

Daylight dazzled his eyes.

""Why you were so foolish?"" demanded a harsh voice. ""The sister says I can talk to you now, so that is what I first want to know.""

He looked at the face of—not the musician; that had been delirium. But it was a tough old face.

""Ja, I am mean-looking; that is settled. What did you think you were doing without coveralls and way over your exposure time?""

""I wanted to die,"" said Halvorsen. There were tubes sticking in his arms.

The crag-faced old man let out a contemptuous bellow.

""Sister!"" he shouted. ""Pull the plasma tubes out before more we waste. He says he wants to die.""

""Hush,"" said the nurse. She laid her hand on his brow again.

""Don't bother with him, Sister,"" the old man jeered. ""He is a shrinking little flower, too delicate for the great, rough world. He has done nothing, he can do nothing, so he decides to make of himself a nuisance by dying.""

""You lie,"" said Halvorsen. ""I worked. Good God, how I worked! Nobody wanted my work. They wanted me, to wear in their buttonholes like a flower. They were getting to me. Another year and I wouldn't have been an artist any more.""

""Ja?"" asked the old man. ""Tell me about it.""

Halvorsen told him, sometimes weeping with self-pity and weakness, sometimes cursing the old man for not letting him die, sometimes quietly describing this statuette or that portrait head, or raving wildly against the mad folly of the world.

At the last he told the old man about Lucy.

""You cannot have everything, you know,"" said his listener.

""I can have her,"" answered the artist harshly. ""You wouldn't let me die, so I won't die. I'll go back and I'll take her away from that fat-head Malone that she ought to marry. I'll give her a couple of happy years working herself to skin and bones for me before she begins to hate it—before I begin to hate it.""

""You can't go back,"" said the old man. ""I'm Cerberus. You understand that? The girl is nothing. The society you come from is nothing. We have a place here.... Sister, can he sit up?""

The woman smiled and cranked his bed. Halvorsen saw through a picture window that he was in a mountain-rimmed valley that was very green and dotted with herds and unpainted houses.

""Such a place there had to be,"" said the old man. ""In the whole geography of Europe, there had to be a Soltau Valley with winds and terrain just right to deflect the dust.""

""Nobody knows?"" whispered the artist.

""We prefer it that way. It's impossible to get some things, but you would be surprised how little difference it makes to the young people. They are great travelers, the young people, in their sweaty coveralls with radiation meters. They think when they see the ruined cities that the people who lived in them must have been mad. It was a little travel party like that which found you. The boy was impressed by something you said, and I saw some interesting things in your hands. There isn't much rock around here; we have fine deep topsoil. But the boys could get you stone.

""There should be a statue of the Mayor for one thing, before I die. And from the Rathaus the wooden angels have mostly broken off. Soltau Valley used to be proud of them—could you make good copies? And of course cameras are useless and the best drawings we can do look funny. Could you teach the youngers at least to draw so faces look like faces and not behinds? And like you were saying about you and Labuerre, maybe one younger there will be so crazy that he will want to learn it all, so Soltau will always have an artist and sculptor for the necessary work. And you will find a Lucy or somebody better. I think better.""

""Hush,"" warned the nurse. ""You're exciting the patient.""

""It's all right,"" said Halvorsen eagerly. ""Thanks, but it's really all right.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""With These Hands"" by C. M. Kornbluth revolves around the struggle between traditional art and the encroaching dominance of technology, specifically the stereopantograph (S.P.G.), which creates art-like products that are cheaper and more accessible. The protagonist, Roald Halvorsen, is a traditional sculptor who faces obsolescence as society increasingly values the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of machine-made art over the craftsmanship and soul of hand-made creations.

Halvorsen's personal dilemma is tied to his identity and livelihood as an artist. He grapples with the diminishing demand for his work, which leaves him financially strained and emotionally demoralized. The story explores his internal conflict between preserving his artistic integrity and adapting to a world that no longer appreciates his skills. As he navigates these challenges, Halvorsen must confront his pride, his survival instincts, and his desire for meaningful human connections in a society that seems to have moved past the need for artists like him.

The broader societal conflict is embodied in the tension between art as a humanistic pursuit and the utilitarian approach of modern technology. Halvorsen's interactions with various characters, such as Monsignor Reedy, his students, and Lucy Grumman, further highlight the themes of artistic authenticity, economic necessity, and the personal sacrifices involved in staying true to one's craft in an unsympathetic world. Ultimately, Halvorsen's journey leads him to a place where traditional values and craftsmanship are still appreciated, offering a glimmer of hope for finding purpose and community.",Would you trade your life's passion for a machine that creates art without a soul?,What would you do if your art was replaced by a machine's cold perfection?,What happens when technology makes your life's work irrelevant?

**How to Tell a Story**

The humorous story is an American creation, different from comic and witty stories. I don’t claim to be the best storyteller, but I know how a story should be told. I’ve spent a lot of time with great storytellers.

There are many types of stories, but the humorous story is the hardest to tell. The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, and the witty story is French. The humorous story relies on how it’s told, while the others rely on the content.

A humorous story can be long and wandering, with no specific destination, while comic and witty stories need to be short and end with a punchline. The humorous story flows gently, but the others hit you with a bang.

Telling a humorous story is an art, a delicate one, and only an artist can do it well. Telling a comic or witty story doesn’t require as much skill; anyone can do it. The art of telling a humorous story is mainly done by speaking, not writing, and it started in America.

The humorous story is told seriously, with the storyteller pretending not to know it’s funny. In contrast, the teller of a comic story will announce how funny it is, tell it with excitement, and be the first to laugh. If it goes well, they might repeat the punchline and look for applause, which can be a bit sad to see.

Sometimes, a humorous story ends with a punchline, and the listener needs to be attentive because the storyteller might drop it casually, pretending not to notice it’s a punchline. People like Artemus Ward used this trick. When the audience finally gets the joke, he would act surprised, as though he didn’t know why they were laughing.

Comic storytellers, on the other hand, emphasize the punchline loudly and clearly. They might even italicize it in print or add exclamation points and explanations, which can be discouraging and make one think about giving up joking.

Here's an example of a comic story:

**The Wounded Soldier**

During a battle, a soldier who lost a leg asked another soldier to carry him to safety. The other soldier agreed, carried him, and dodged bullets and cannonballs. But a cannonball took the wounded man's head off, and his helper didn’t notice. An officer asked, “Where are you taking that body?” The soldier replied, “To the rear, sir—he's lost his leg!” The officer said, “His leg? You mean his head, you fool.” The soldier put down the body and said, “It is true, sir, just as you said. But he told me it was his leg.”

The storyteller laughs loudly, repeating the punchline. Told this way, the story is short and not very funny. But James Whitcomb Riley tells it as a humorous story, taking ten minutes, and it’s hilarious.

Riley tells it as a slow-witted farmer who heard it for the first time and finds it funny but can’t remember it well. He gets mixed up, adds unnecessary details, corrects himself, and tries to remember the soldier’s name, only to realize it wasn’t mentioned. He laughs at himself throughout, and the audience laughs until they cry.

The farmer’s innocence and sincerity make the performance charming and delightful. This is art—only a master can do it. But anyone can tell a comic story.

Part of the American art of storytelling is stringing absurdities together and acting unaware of their silliness. Another part is underplaying the punchline. Sometimes, a storyteller drops a remark as if thinking out loud. Then there’s the pause.

Artemus Ward often used pauses. He would tell something exciting, then lose confidence, pause, and add an unexpected remark that would surprise the audience. The pause is crucial; it must be the right length to work.

For example, he’d say, “I once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn’t a tooth in his head,” then pause and add dreamily, “and yet that man could beat a drum better than anyone I ever saw.”

The pause is important in any story. If it’s too short, the moment is lost; if too long, the audience expects a surprise, and you can’t surprise them.

On stage, I used to tell a ghost story with a crucial pause before the punchline. If timed right, it could startle someone into a little scream. This story is called “The Golden Arm,” and it goes like this:

**The Golden Arm**

Once there was a mean man who lived alone with his wife on the prairie. One night, his wife died, and he buried her. She had a golden arm, and he wanted it badly. At midnight, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He took a lantern, went out in the storm, dug her up, and took the golden arm. As he walked back through the snow, he stopped, startled, and said, “My land, what’s that?” He listened, and the wind said, “Who got my golden arm?” He began to shiver and shake, saying, “Oh my! Oh my land!” The wind blew out his lantern, and he struggled home, terrified. Soon he heard the voice again, “Who got my golden arm?” He rushed upstairs, jumped into bed, and covered up, shaking. Then he heard it again, closer, “Who got my golden arm?” He felt something cold near him, and the voice said, “Who got my golden arm?” At that moment, you stare at the audience and, after a pause, jump and yell, “You’ve got it!” If the pause is right, someone will scream and jump. But timing the pause is tricky.

**Mental Telegraphy Again**

I have some curious stories to tell. They relate to what I called “Mental Telegraphy” years ago. I wrote about it in a paper published in Harper’s Magazine.

Years ago, I traveled with Mr. George W. Cable. In Montreal, we had a reception. I stood with Mr. Cable, shaking hands with people. My eyesight is good, and I spotted a familiar face in the crowd. It was Mrs. R., an old friend I hadn’t seen in twenty years. I was surprised and happy. I noticed her dress and waited for her to reach us, but she never did.

That evening, someone told me there was a friend waiting to see me. I thought it must be Mrs. R. When I entered the room, I saw her dressed exactly as I’d seen her earlier. I went up to her, called her by name, and said, “I knew you at the reception this afternoon.” She was surprised and said, “But I wasn’t at the reception. I just arrived from Quebec.” I was shocked. I had seen her clearly, but she hadn’t been there. How do you explain that? I think she was thinking of me, and her thoughts reached me.

My next story might seem like a coincidence to some. I once thought of making a lecturing trip through the antipodes but always dismissed it. In January, the idea came back strongly, seemingly without reason. I was in Paris and wrote to Henry M. Stanley in London, asking about his Australian tour. His reply came, mentioning Mr. R. S. Smythe as the agent to contact. I wrote to Mr. Smythe on February 3rd, asking for the same terms as Stanley.

Three days later, I received a letter from Mr. Smythe, dated December 17th, offering me the same terms. It was as if he answered my letter before I sent it. I might have saved the trouble of writing. The idea must have come from Mr. Smythe.

Another story: In March, I was in America with Mr. John Brisben Walker. We went to the Century Club for lunch, and he asked why I wasn’t a member. I joked about asking the Lotos Club to make me an honorary member to avoid dues. That afternoon, I traveled to Hartford, and Mr. F. G. Whitmore told me the Lotos Club had made me a life member. What had put the idea in my head? It must have come from the club directors.

Next story: I visited a niece at Miss Porter’s school in Farmington with Rev. Joseph H. Twichell. On the way, I told an anecdote about meeting a lieutenant in Milan. At the school, a young lady approached, introduced herself to Mr. Twichell, and then to me, saying we met in Milan. What made me think of that story? Was it her presence, or just a coincidence?

**The Invalid's Story**

I look like I’m sixty and married, but I’m actually forty-one and single. Two years ago, I was strong and healthy, but that changed after a two-hundred-mile train journey with a box of guns.

I’m from Cleveland, Ohio. Two years ago, I returned home during a snowstorm and learned my best friend, John B. Hackett, had died. His last wish was for me to take his body to his parents in Wisconsin. I hurried to the train station, found the coffin, and labeled it. I saw it loaded onto the express car and went to get a sandwich. When I returned, I saw what seemed to be my coffin again, but another man was labeling it. I was confused until I saw my box was still on the train. I didn’t know I had taken a box of guns meant for Peoria, and the other man had my friend’s body.

The train left, and I sat near the guns. The expressman, Thompson, was a kind and cheerful man. A stranger placed a package of old Limburger cheese on the box of guns. I had never heard of Limburger cheese and didn’t know its smell.

As we traveled, the storm raged, and a terrible smell filled the air. I thought it was my friend’s body and felt sad. Thompson didn’t notice at first. He made a fire in the stove, but the heat made the smell worse. I grew pale and worried.

Thompson eventually noticed the smell and thought it was my friend. He tried to comfort me, saying everyone has to die. He suggested we move the box to the other end of the car. We tried, but he slipped and fell on the cheese, which made the smell unbearable. We had to escape to the platform for fresh air.

Thompson tried using carbolic acid to mask the smell, but it only made things worse. We kept escaping to the platform, freezing in the cold. He brought more things to burn, hoping the smoke would help, but it didn’t. We were forced to stay outside, knowing we couldn’t beat the smell.

Finally, we reached a station and were found frozen and unconscious. I recovered three weeks later, learning I had traveled with guns and cheese, not a body. But it was too late; my health was ruined, and I was on my way home to die.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in Mark Twain's ""How to Tell a Story and Others"" emerges from the exploration of the art and technique of storytelling, particularly focusing on the distinction and challenges between telling a humorous story versus a comic or witty one. Twain presents the dilemma of how the delivery and style of a story can significantly impact its reception and effectiveness. This is illustrated through examples such as ""The Wounded Soldier"" and ""The Golden Arm,"" where the narrative's humor is heavily dependent on the storyteller's skill in timing, tone, and subtlety.

In ""How to Tell a Story,"" Twain contrasts the American humorous story, which relies on the manner of telling and often includes a wandering, leisurely style, with the more direct and punchline-focused comic and witty stories typical of English and French traditions. The conflict lies in the challenge of mastering the subtle art of humorous storytelling, where the teller must maintain a facade of seriousness and allow the humor to emerge naturally, often requiring a sophisticated understanding of timing and audience engagement.

The other stories, ""Mental Telegraphy Again"" and ""The Invalid's Story,"" further explore themes of perception, coincidence, and misunderstanding. In ""The Invalid's Story,"" the conflict arises from a series of mistaken identities and assumptions, leading to an absurd and tragicomic situation that ultimately affects the narrator's health and future. This story highlights the impact of perception and misunderstanding, woven with Twain's humor, to underscore the unpredictability and irony of human experience.

Overall, the central conflict is the tension between intention and perception in storytelling, where the success of a humorous story depends on the teller's ability to navigate and manipulate these elements skillfully.",Is the humor in the words or the way they’re spoken?

008.txt,"This is how it all started—the terrible fight that tears our world apart!

The old lady with the big shopping bag was right in the middle of the crosswalk when she noticed the big black car coming straight at her.

Behind the thick, bullet-proof glass, the seven people in the car looked blurry, like they were in a diving bell.

She realized she couldn't make it to the sidewalk in time. The car would catch her in the street.

Trying to trick the car and dodge it, like kids do, was useless because she wasn't fast enough.

The car's loudspeaker made a polite, empty laugh over the roar of the engine.

People on the sidewalks gasped in horror.

The old lady reached into her shopping bag and pulled out a big blue-black gun. She held it with both hands, shooting like a cowboy on a wild horse.

She aimed at the bottom of the windshield, like a hunter aims at a charging animal, and fired three shots before the car hit her.

From the sidewalk, a young woman in a wheelchair yelled a bad word at the people in the car.

Smythe-de Winter, the driver, was upset. The old lady's last shot killed two people in his car. The bullet went through the glass, through Phipps-McHeath's neck, and into Horvendile-Harker's head.

Smythe-de Winter angrily drove the car onto the sidewalk. People jumped out of the way, including a boy on crutches.

But he still hit the girl in the wheelchair.

Then he quickly drove out of the poor neighborhood into the suburbs, feeling angry and sad. The world around him seemed to be falling apart.

While his friends cleaned up the mess in the car, he shook his head.

""They shouldn't let old ladies have guns,"" he said.

Witherspoon-Hobbs agreed. ""They shouldn't let them have anything. I hate people who walk,"" he said, looking at his small legs. ""Cars forever!"" he quietly cheered.

The incident caused a big stir in the city. At the funeral for the old lady and the girl in the wheelchair, a speaker accused the rich people in the suburbs of being bullies. He talked about how pedestrians were once respected in old Los Angeles, even outside crosswalks. He called for a protest on the golf courses and fancy neighborhoods of the motorists.

At the crematorium for Phipps and Horvy, another speaker reminded people of old Chicago, where pedestrians weren't allowed to carry guns and were easy targets. He hinted that burning down the slums might be the only solution.

Groups of young people from the slums came into the suburbs, slashing tires, shooting dogs, and writing bad words on cars.

Meanwhile, young suburbanites on motorcycles drove through the slums, scaring children, throwing stink-bombs, and painting graffiti on homes.

Incidents were even reported in the city center, usually neutral ground.

The Government quickly acted, stopping all traffic between the city center and the suburbs and setting a 24-hour curfew in the slums. Government agents moved around in neutral vehicles to show they didn't take sides.

The day of no movement was spent preparing for revenge. In garages, people mounted guns under car hoods, welded blades to hubcaps, and sharpened fenders. In the slums, people prepared weapons and traps for cars. Children got ready to soap intersections. The Pedestrian Safety Committee, also known as Robespierre's Rats, got their anti-tank guns ready.

At night, under government pressure, representatives of the pedestrians and motorists met on a safety island between the slums and the suburbs.

Assistants argued about details like whether Smythe-de Winter honked before charging, if the old lady shot first, and how many wheels were on the sidewalk when he hit the wheelchair girl. Meanwhile, the leaders exchanged knowing looks and stepped aside.

Under the flickering light of kerosene flares and lamps, the leaders talked.

""What's the mental state of your people?"" the Chief Motorist whispered.

""Forty-one and dropping,"" the High Pedestrian replied, looking around nervously. ""I can barely find sane helpers.""

""Our score is thirty-seven,"" the Chief Motorist said. ""My people's minds are slowing down. I doubt they'll speed up in my lifetime.""

""They say the Government's score is fifty-two,"" the other leader said.

""Well, let's try to make another compromise,"" one suggested, ""though sometimes I think we're all just part of a crazy dream.""

After two hours, they agreed on new rules. Pedestrian guns were limited to .38 caliber, and motorists had to honk three times before charging a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Hitting someone with two wheels on the sidewalk was now a minor offense. Blind pedestrians could carry grenades.

The Government quickly spread the news of the new rules. Police and social workers went through the slums, taking away big weapons and calming people down. Therapists and mechanics visited homes in the suburbs, promoting calmness and removing illegal car weapons. A bullfight was planned to release tension, but it was canceled due to protests from the Decency League, which included both pedestrians and motorists.

At dawn, the curfew was lifted, and traffic resumed. It seemed things were back to normal.

Smythe-de Winter drove his shiny black car through the area. A steel bolt filled the hole the old lady's bullet had made in the windshield.

A brick bounced off the roof. Bullets hit the side windows.

Smythe-de wiped his neck with a handkerchief and smiled.

Ahead, kids were playing in the street, teasing him. A fat dog with a spiked collar followed them.

Smythe-de suddenly sped up. He missed the kids but hit the dog.

A light on the dashboard showed the tire was losing air. It must have hit the collar too! He pressed a button, and the light went off.

He turned to Witherspoon-Hobbs and said, ""I like a normal, orderly world, where there's a little success and a little failure.""

Witherspoon-Hobbs looked at the crosswalk. ""That's where you got the old lady,"" he said. ""She had spirit.""

""Yes, that's where I got her,"" Smythe-de said. He remembered her face and wild eyes and suddenly felt that the day was very dull.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around the escalating tension and violence between pedestrians and motorists, symbolizing a deeper societal divide between the rich and the poor, or more broadly, between different social classes. The initial incident where an old lady is killed by a car driven by affluent individuals sets off a chain reaction of hostilities, highlighting issues of class conflict, inequality, and the dehumanization of individuals based on their social status or mode of transportation.

This conflict is exacerbated by a lack of understanding and empathy between the two groups, each viewing the other as a threat or nuisance. The story depicts a world where the value of human life has diminished, and societal norms have broken down, leading to a dystopian reality where violence and retaliation are commonplace.

The dilemma faced by both sides is how to coexist peacefully in a world where their interests and ways of life are fundamentally at odds. Despite attempts at compromise and government intervention, the underlying animosity persists, suggesting that the resolution is fragile and temporary.

Ultimately, the story critiques the absurdity and futility of such conflicts, illustrating how societal breakdown and dehumanization can lead to a cycle of violence and revenge, with neither side truly winning or finding satisfaction.",Imagine living in a world where pedestrians carry grenades to feel safe.,Could you find peace in a world where motorists and pedestrians are at constant war?,What would you do if your city turned into a battleground between cars and walkers?

One day, he got to work early and was waiting in the lab when Frank Barnes, the head chemist, arrived.

Frank immediately became even more nervous. ""Bill Detrick called about it yesterday, Mr. Parry. I'm sorry if I was rude to him.""

Amos smiled. ""If you were, he hasn't told me yet. But we should get moving on this. Buffalo will probably start asking questions soon. How many people are working on it?""

""Well, two are helping with routine work, but I've been doing most of it myself, nights and weekends. I didn't want anyone to know too much about it. Mr. Parry, I'm worried about it.""

""Worried? How so?""

""Let me show you the pigs we've been testing it on.""

The pigs were outside in pens. Amos had seen reports about their weight gain and health, which seemed promising, but he hadn't seen the pigs themselves for a couple of weeks. He looked at the first group. ""How old is that boar pig?""

""Not quite four months.""

Amos wasn't an expert, but he had spent a lot of time on farms, and the pig looked older than four months. The other pigs in the pen looked similar—more mature than they should, and a bit fat. They all looked strange, not like normal pigs of that breed and age. ""Is it just the general health factor?"" Amos asked.

""I don't think so, Mr. Parry. Remember, I told you this isn't actually a hormone.""

""I know. You wanted to call it that for secrecy.""

""Yes, sir, but I didn't tell you what it really was. Mr. Parry, are you familiar with hypnotics? Mescaline, especially?""

""No, I'm not, Frank.""

""Well, it's a drug that causes strong hallucinations. This is a chemical version of it.""

Amos grinned. ""Pipe dreams for pigs?""

But then he stopped smiling as the implications hit him. If this thing didn't work out after all the money they'd spent, there would be some serious questions from Buffalo. And if it did work, and they started selling it...

""What would it do to humans?"" Amos asked.

Barnes avoided his eyes. ""That's one of the things I'm worried about,"" he said. ""I want to show you another pig.""

This pig was in its own pen, and it looked even stranger than the others. Its hair was thicker and black. There was something weird about the way it moved, like it was trying to mimic something else. It made Amos' skin crawl.

""What's wrong with it?"" he asked.

""It's healthy, except for how it looks and acts.""

""Same litter and dosage?""

""Yes, sir. They all got just one dose. The effects seem to be permanent.""

They leaned over the fence, and the pig looked up at them. There was something odd in its eyes—not intelligence exactly, but something not pig-like. Suddenly, it stood up on its hind legs, put its front feet against the fence, and raised its head toward them. It squealed like it wanted attention. Amos knew that pigs could be affectionate. Drawn to it, he reached down and patted it, and the squealing stopped.

It was standing too easily in that position, and suddenly Amos realized what was familiar about it. He jerked his hand away, feeling a strong desire for soap and water. ""How long's it been like this?""

""It's changed fast in the last week.""

Amos looked toward the doorway of the lab, where a large black tomcat sat watching them. ""Is the cat out here a lot?""

Barnes' eyes went to the cat, widened, and turned back to the pig. He looked as sick as Amos felt.

When Amos got to his office, his sales manager was waiting. Amos noticed the stuffed briefcase and the overly wide smile as he responded automatically to the pleasantries. ""Just get back?"" he asked.

""Early train. Darned planes grounded again."" Detrick looked full of energy, even though he'd probably rushed home, shaved, showered, and hurried to the office with no rest. He sat down, took papers out of his briefcase, and beamed. ""Wrote up the Peach Association.""

He'll give me the good news first, Amos thought. ""Fine, fine,"" he said. ""The whole year?""

""Yep. Got a check from the Almond Growers, too. All paid up now.""

""Good,"" said Amos, and waited.

It came. ""Say, I was talking to Frank Barnes about that new hormone he's got, and he seemed a little negative about it. When do you think we can have it?""

It was tempting to answer with false optimism and avoid the issue for a while, but Amos said, ""The slowest thing will be State and Federal testing and registration. I'd say not less than a year.""

Detrick nodded. ""Competition's selling more and more stuff that's not registered.""

""Fly-by-night outfits, and they're always getting caught.""

Detrick smiled. ""Every night they fly away with more business.""

Amos managed a smile, though the argument was old and weary. ""We'll put it up to Buffalo if you want to, Bill. You know I can't approve it myself.""

Detrick dropped the subject, not being someone to beat his head against a stone wall if there were ways around it, and for the next hour, Amos had to listen to the troubles: competition had cut prices on this, increased active ingredients in that, introduced new products (Whelan's factories and warehouses already groaned under a crippling diversity of products, but Sales didn't see that as their problem), and even the credit policies needed revising. But the worst of all was a fifteen-thousand-dollar claim for damage to pear trees, caused by a bad batch of Whelan's insecticide.

Amos got rid of Detrick with a few definite concessions, some tentative ones, and some stand-offs. He made sure no one was waiting to see him and told his secretary he didn't want to be bothered before lunch.

He had a lunch date with a customer and dreaded it—it meant three or four highballs, overeating, and an upset stomach later. Before then, though, he had a few minutes to try to get his mind straightened out. He mixed a glassful of the stuff he was supposed to take about now. The Complete Executive, he thought, with physician and prescription attached. It didn't seem possible that this same body had once breezed through anything from football to fried potatoes.

Mechanically, his mind on the lab's pigs, he got a small bag of grain out of a desk drawer. He hoped nobody (except his secretary, of course) knew he wasted time feeding pigeons, but it helped his nerves, and he felt he had a right to one or two eccentricities.

They were already waiting. Some of them knew him and didn't fly away when he opened the window and scattered grain on the ledge outside. A few ate from his hand.

It was a crisp day, but the sun slanting into the window was warm. He leaned there, watching the birds—more were circling in now—and looking out over the industrial part of the city. The rude shapes were softened by haze, and there was nothing noisy close by. He could almost imagine it as some countryside.

He looked at his watch, sighed, pulled his head in, and shut the window. The air conditioner's hiss replaced the outside sounds.

Not even imagination could get rid of the city for long.

Heading through the outer office, he saw that Alice Grant, his secretary, was already having lunch at her desk. She was a young thirty, not very tall, and just a little plump. She wore her blonde hair pulled back into a knot that didn't succeed in making her look severe, and her features were well-formed and regular, if plain. Amos noticed a new bruise on one cheek and wondered how long she'd stay with her husband, who drank too much. There were no children to keep her there.

""I'll probably be back late,"" he said. ""Anything scheduled for this afternoon?""

""Just Jim at two-thirty and the union agent at three.""

The lunch didn't go too badly, with the drinks the customer liked, and Amos was feeling only slightly uneasy when he got back.

A stormy session with his plant superintendent brought him back to his usual worries. Jim Glover was furious at having to take the fifteen-thousand-dollar claim, though it was clearly a factory error. He also fought a stubborn delaying action before giving Amos an estimate of fifty thousand to equip for the new drug. He complained that Frank Barnes hadn't given him enough information.

Amos was still trembling from that encounter when the union business agent arrived. The lunch was beginning to lump up, and he didn't spar effectively. Not that it made much difference. The union was going to have a raise or else. By the time he'd squirmed through that interview, then dictated a few letters, it was time to go home.

He hoped his wife would be out so he could relax, but she met him at the door with a verbal barrage. Their son, who lived at home but went to college, had gotten a ticket for drunk driving, and Amos was supposed to fix it; the Templetons were coming for the weekend; her brother's son was graduating and thought he might accept a position with Amos.

She paused and studied him. ""I hope this isn't one of your grumpy evenings. The Ashtons are coming for bridge.""

His control slipped a little, and he expressed himself strongly against playing bridge on Wednesday night, after a nightclub party on Tuesday and an informal gathering at somebody's house on Monday.

She stared at him without compassion or understanding. ""Well, they're all business associates of yours. I wonder where you think you'd be without a wife who was willing to entertain.""

He'd been hearing a lot of that lately; she was squeezing the role of Executive's Wife for the last drop of satisfaction. Well, since he couldn't relax, there was only one thing to do. He headed for the bar.

""Now don't get tipsy before dinner,"" she called after him.

He got through the evening well enough, thanks to martinis, and the night that followed was no worse than most.

At nine the next morning, the call he'd been expecting from Buffalo came through. ""Hello, Stu,"" he said to the president of the company.

""Hello, Amos. Still morning out there, eh? How's the family? Good. Say, Amos; couple of things. This big factory charge. Production's screaming.""

""It was definitely a bad batch, Stu.""

""Well, that's it, then. Question is, how'd it happen?""

""Jim Glover says he needs another control chemist.""

""Hope you're not practicing false economy out there.""

""We wanted to hire another man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it down.""

""You should have brought it to me personally if it was that important. It's going to take a big bite out of your year's profit. Been able to get your margin up any?""

Amos didn't feel up to pointing out that Sales wanted lower prices and the union wanted higher wages, so that the margin would get even worse. He described a couple of minor economies he'd been able to find, then mentioned the contract with the Peach Association.

""Yes, I heard about that,"" said the president of the company. ""Nice piece of business. By the way, how you coming on that animal hormone?""

That was the main reason for the call, of course. Detrick had undoubtedly called and implied that Amos was dragging his feet on a potential gold mine. ""I was going to call you on that, Stu. It'll take a year to test and get registered and—""

""Amos, I hope you're not turning conservative on us.""

The message was plain; Amos countered automatically. ""You know me better than that, Stu. It's the Legal Department I'm worried about. If they set up a lot of roadblocks, we may need you to run interference.""

""You know I'm always right behind you, Amos.""

That's true, thought Amos as he hung up. Right behind me. A lousy place to run interference.

He knew exactly what to expect. If he tried to cut corners, the Legal Department would complain about proper testing and registration, Production would say he was pushing Jim Glover unreasonably, and everyone who could would take highly moral positions on the fence. A ton of paperwork would go to Buffalo to be distributed among fifty desks and expertly stalled.

Not to mention that this was no ordinary product. He realized for the first time that the Government might not let him produce it, let alone sell it. Even as a small part in feeds. If it was a narcotic, it could be misused.

His buzzer sounded, and he was surprised when Mrs. Grant announced Frank Barnes. It was unusual for Frank not to make a formal appointment first.

One look told Amos what was coming. He listened to Frank's resignation with half his mind while the rest of it mused on how things seemed to be coming together.

Barnes stopped talking, and Amos said mechanically, ""You've been part of the team for a long time, Frank. It's especially awkward to lose you just now."" It was banal, but it didn't matter; he wasn't going to change Frank's mind anyway. He looked closer. The timidity was gone. So were the glasses. A frightening thought struck him. ""You've taken some of that drug.""

Barnes grinned and handed a small vial full of powder and a file folder across the desk. ""Last night,"" he said. ""Between frustration with the job and curiosity about this stuff, I gave in.""

Amos took the vial and folder. ""What are these for?""

""So you can destroy them if you want to. I've fixed up the lab records to make it look like the whole thing was a false alarm. You're holding all that's left of the program.""

Amos looked for signs of irrationality and saw none. ""Do you feel okay?""

""Better than you can imagine. But let me tell you what you're up against. I can at least do that for you, Mr. Parry.""

""Thanks. Don't you suppose you could call me Amos now?""

""Sure, Amos. First of all, you were right about that pig trying to imitate the cat. He couldn't do much because he only had a pig's brain to work with."" He stopped and grinned, probably at Amos' expression. ""I'll try to explain. What is an animal? Physically, I mean?""

Amos shook his head. ""You've got the floor.""

""All right. An animal is a colony of cells. Different kinds of cells form organs and do different things for the colony, but each cell has a life of its own, too. When it dies, a new one of the same kind takes over. But what regulates the colony? What maintains the pattern?""

Amos waited.

""Part of it's automatic replacement, cell for cell. But beyond that, there's a control, and it's the unconscious mind."" He paused and studied Amos. ""You think I'm theorizing. I'm not. That drug broke down some barriers, and I see all this as you see your own fingers moving.""

Amos remembered the mention of hallucinations.

Barnes grinned again. ""Let's say it's only one percent awake and walled off from the conscious mind. What would happen if something removed the wall and woke up the other ninety-nine percent?""

Remembering the pig, it was impossible not to feel a cold seed of belief. Amos dreaded what was coming next; clearly, it would be a demonstration.

Barnes held out his hand, palm up. In a few seconds, a pink spot appeared. It turned red, oozed, and became a small pool of blood. Barnes let it stay for a moment, then wiped it off with a handkerchief. There was no more bleeding. ""That's something I can do fast,"" he said. ""I opened the pores, directed blood to them, then closed them again. Amos, do you believe in werewolves?""

Amos wanted to jump up and shout, ""No! You're insane!"" but he could only sit staring.

""I could move that thumb around to the other side of my hand,"" Barnes said thoughtfully. ""I'm still exploring, but I don't think even the bone would take too long. You'll notice I don't need glasses anymore.""

The buzzer buzzed. Amos jumped, and from habit answered. ""Bill Detrick and that customer are here, Mr. Parry,"" came Alice Grant's voice.

""I—ask them to wait,"" he managed.

His mind was a muddle; he needed time. ""You—Frank—will you stay for a few days?""

""Sure. I'm in no hurry now. And while you're thinking, let me give you a few hints. No more cripples or disease. No ugly people, unless they choose to be. And no law.""

""No—law?""

""How would you police such a world? A man could change his face at will, or his fingerprints. Even his teeth. Probably he could do things I can't imagine yet.""

The buzzer went again, with Mrs. Grant's subtle urgency. Amos ignored it, yet he hardly knew when Frank left the room.

He realized the chemist had done him a favor. The selfish thing would have been to keep the secret and the boon all to himself; instead, he'd given Amos the choice.

But what was the choice? Suppressing the drug would cost him his job. There was no doubt about that.

He was standing with his back to the door when he heard it open. He turned and faced Detrick's annoyed frown. ""Amos, we can't keep this man waiting. He's—""

All of Amos' frustration and the new burden came together into rage. He ran toward Detrick. ""You baboon-faced huckster!"" he yelled. ""Get out! Get out! I'll tell you when you can come in here!"" He barely caught his raised fist in time.

Detrick stood frozen, his face ridiculous. Then he came to life, ducked out, and pulled the door shut behind him.

Amos waited no longer; if he had to decide, he wanted the information first-hand. He spread out the file Barnes had left him and looked through it for dosages. Apparently, it wasn't critical, so he poured a little of the powder into a tumbler, added water, and drank it down. There was a mild alkaline taste, which he washed out of his mouth with more water. Then he sat down to wait.

A monotone seemed to be rattling off trivia; almost faster than he could grasp it, even though it was in his head and not in his ears: ""Paris green/calcium acetoarsenite/beetle invasion Texan cotton/paint pigment/obsolete/should eliminate/compensation claim/man probably faking infection/Detrick likes because we only source/felt like hitting him when we argued about it/correspondence Buffalo last year/they say keep/check how use as poison/damned wife—""

The last thought shocked his intellect awake. ""Hey!"" Intellect demanded. ""What's going on here?""

""Oh; you've broken through,"" said Unconscious. ""That was fast. Fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds since you drank it. Probable error, one-third second. I've only been awake a few minutes myself. Minute/sixty per hour/twenty-four hours day/days getting shorter/September/have raincoat in car/wife wants new car/raincoat sweats plasticizer/stinks/Hyatt used camphor—""

""Hold up a minute!"" cried Intellect.

""You want me to stop scanning?""

""Is that what you're doing? Scanning what?""

""Memory banks, of course. Don't you remember the book we read three years ago? 'Human brain estimated—' Oh, all right; I'll slow down. You could follow me better if you'd let me grow some permanent direct connections.""

""Am I stopping you?""

""Well, not you, exactly. I'll show you."" Unconscious began directing the growth of certain nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos could only follow it vaguely.

""Fear!"" screamed a soundless voice. ""Stop!""

""What was that?"" Intellect asked, startled.

""That was Id. He always fights any improvements, and I can't override him.""

""Can _I_?""

""Of course; that's mainly what you're for. Wait till I get these connections finished and you'll see the whole setup.""

""FEAR!"" shrieked Id. ""STOP! NO CHANGE!""

""SHUT UP!"" yelled Intellect.

It was strange being integrated; Amos found he was aware on two levels simultaneously. While he responded normally to his external environment, a lightning inner vision saw everything in vastly greater detail. The blink of an eye, for instance, was an amazing project. Even as commands flashed out and before the muscles started to respond, extra blood was rushing into the area to nourish the working parts. Reports flowed back like battle assessments: these three muscles were on schedule; this was lagging; that was pulling too hard. An infinitesimal twinge of pain marked some minor accident, and correction began at once. A censor watched the whole operation and labeled each incoming report: trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; worth watching, record in temporary banks; trivial, do not....

He felt now that he could look forward to permanent health, and so far he didn't seem to be losing his identity or becoming a moral monster (though certain previously buried urges—toward Alice Grant, for instance—were now rather embarrassingly uncovered). He was not, like Frank Barnes, inclined to slip out of the situation at once. He still felt the responsibility to make the decision.

He carried the vial of powder and the lab records home with him, smuggled them past his wife's chatter (it didn't bother him now) and hid them. He went out with her cheerfully to visit some people he didn't like and found himself amused at them instead of annoyed. In general, he felt buoyant, and they stayed quite late.

When they did get home, an urgent message was waiting on the telephone recorder, and it jolted him. He grabbed up the hat and coat he'd just laid down.

""What is it?"" his wife demanded.

""I've got to go down to the plant."" He hesitated; it was hard to say the words that were charged with personal significance. ""The watchman found Frank Barnes dead in the laboratory.""

""Who?""

""Frank Barnes! My chief chemist!""

""Oh."" She looked at him, obviously concerned only with what effect, if any, it might have on her own circumstances. ""Why do you have to get mixed up in it?""

""I'm the boss, damn it!"" He left her standing there and ran for the garage.

The police were already at the plant when he arrived. Fred's body lay on the floor of his office, in a corner behind some file cabinets, face up.

""What was it?"" Amos asked the man from the coroner's office, dreading the answer he expected.

The answer wasn't the one he expected. ""Heart attack.""

Amos wondered if they were mistaken. He looked around the office. Things weren't disarrayed in any way; it looked as if Frank had simply lain down and died. ""When did you find him?"" he asked the watchman.

""A little after one. The door was closed and the lights were out, but I heard the cat yowling in here, so I came in to let it out and saw the body.""

""Any family?"" one of the city men asked.

""No,"" said Amos slowly, ""he lived alone. I guess you might as well take him to the ... morgue. When can I call about the autopsy?""

""Try after lunch.""

Amos watched them carry Frank away. Then he put out the lights and closed up the laboratory. He told the watchman he'd be around for a while and went to his office to think.

As nearly as he knew, Frank had taken the drug less than twenty-four hours before he had. Death had come late at night, which meant Frank had been working overtime. Why? And why hadn't he been able to save himself?

""Not logical,"" his unconscious stated firmly. ""He should have felt it coming and made repairs.""

""This whole thing's a delusion,"" said Amos dully, aloud.

""No, it isn't,"" said a peculiar voice behind him.

He whirled and saw the black tomcat grinning up at him. He gasped, wondering if he were completely insane, but in a flash understanding came. ""Frank!""

""Well, don't act so surprised. I can tell that you took some yourself.""

""Yes—but how—""

""I thought it would be an easy life and I want to stay around here and watch things for a while. It ought to be fun.""

""But _how_?""

""I anesthetized the cat and grew a bridge into his skull. It took five hours to transfer the bulk of my personality. It's odd, but it blended right in with his.""

""But—your speech!""

""I've made some changes. I'm omnivorous now, too, not just carnivorous—or will be in a few more hours. I can go into the hills and live on grass, or grow back into a man, or whatever I like.""

Amos consulted his own inwardness again. ""Is this possible? Can a human mind be compressed into a cat's brain?""

""Sure,"" said Unconscious, ""if you're willing to junk all the excess.""

He thought about it. ""So you're going to stay around and watch,"" he said to the cat—no, Frank. ""An intriguing idea. My family's taken care of, and nobody'll really miss me.""

""Except Alice Grant,"" said Frank cattily. ""I've seen the way you look at her. The cat part of me has, I mean. And she looks back, too, when you aren't watching.""

""Well,"" said Amos. ""Hm. Maybe we can do something there too.""

His own transformation took a lot longer than five hours; he had a much bigger job of alterations to finish. It was nearly two months before he got back to the plant.

He peered in through the window at Detrick, who'd inherited Amos' old office. Detrick was chewing out a salesman. Amos knew what would be happening now; Derrick's ambitious but unsound expansion would have gotten the division all tangled up. In fact, with his sharp new eyes, Amos could read part of a letter from Buffalo that lay on the desk. It was quite critical of Detrick's margin of profit.

The salesman Detrick had on the carpet was a good man, and Amos wondered if he was to blame for whatever it was about. Maybe Detrick was just preparing to throw him to the wolves. A man could hang on a long time like that, shifting the blame to his subordinates.

The salesman was finally excused, and Detrick sat alone with all the frustration and selfish scheming plain on his face. No, Amos thought, I'm not going to turn this drug loose on the world for a while. Not while there are people like Detrick around.

There were no other pigeons on the window ledge except himself and Alice; the rest had stopped coming when Amos disappeared and the feeding ended. For that matter, they tended to avoid him and Alice, possibly because of the abnormal size, especially around the head, and the other differences.

He noticed that Alice was changing the color of her feet again. Just like a woman, he thought fondly.

""Come on, Pigeon,"" he said, ""let's go somewhere else. This tightwad Detrick isn't going to give us anything to eat.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the ethical and personal dilemmas faced by Amos Parry, the regional manager at Whelan, Inc., regarding the development and potential release of a new drug that has profound and unpredictable effects. This conflict is multi-faceted and includes:

1. **Moral and Ethical Dilemma**: Amos is confronted with the decision of whether to proceed with the development and potential sale of a powerful and potentially dangerous drug. The drug, originally intended as a hormone for animals, has unexpected and significant effects, including altering behavior and physiology, as demonstrated by the pigs in the lab. The ethical implications of releasing such a drug into the market, and the potential for misuse if it affects humans similarly, weigh heavily on Amos.

2. **Professional Pressure**: Amos faces immense pressure from various stakeholders, including the sales team, the company's president in Buffalo, and Bill Detrick, the sales manager, to push forward with the drug despite the risks. This pressure creates a professional conflict for Amos, as he must balance the company's financial interests and competitive position with the potential consequences of the drug's release.

3. **Personal Transformation and Discovery**: The story also explores Amos's internal conflict and transformation after he takes the drug himself. The drug awakens parts of his mind and consciousness, leading to a deeper understanding of his own desires and capabilities. This transformation introduces a personal conflict, as Amos must decide how to use his newfound abilities and whether to keep the drug a secret or share its potential with the world.

4. **Societal Impact**: Amos grapples with the broader implications of the drug on society. The potential for a world without disease or physical limitations is contrasted with the chaos and lawlessness that could arise if individuals could alter their appearances and identities at will. This societal conflict highlights the potential for both utopia and dystopia, depending on how the drug is managed and controlled.

Overall, the story is a complex exploration of the moral, professional, and personal conflicts that arise from the discovery of a powerful new technology, and the responsibilities that come with such a discovery.",Would you release a drug that could make people perfect but also lead to chaos and crime?,You're in charge of a drug that could reshape humanity—do you unleash it or lock it away?,Would you hide a discovery that could end illness but also cause anarchy?
