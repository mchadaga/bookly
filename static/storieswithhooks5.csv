000.txt,"The big car with fishhooks welded to its fender came up over the curb like something out of a nightmare. A girl stood in its path, frozen with fear under her mask. For once, my reflexes worked. I quickly stepped towards her, grabbed her elbow, and pulled her back. Her black skirt swirled out as she moved.

The car zoomed by, its engine humming. I caught a glimpse of three faces. Something tore. I felt the hot exhaust on my ankles as the car swerved back into the street. A thick cloud of black smoke puffed from its back, and a black piece of cloth flew off the fishhooks.

""Did they get you?"" I asked the girl.

She turned to look at the side of her skirt, which was torn. She was wearing nylon tights.

""The hooks didn't touch me,"" she said, her voice shaky. ""I guess I'm lucky.""

I heard voices around us:

""Those kids! What'll they think up next?""

""They're a menace. They ought to be arrested.""

Sirens wailed as two police officers on motorbikes zoomed toward us after the car. But the black smoke filled the whole street, making it hard to see. The police switched from speeding to braking and stopped near the smoke cloud.

""Are you English?"" the girl asked me. ""You have an English accent.""

Her voice was shaky behind her black satin mask. I imagined her teeth must be chattering. Her eyes, maybe blue, searched my face through the black gauze of the mask. I told her she was right. She stood close to me. ""Will you come to my place tonight?"" she asked quickly. ""I can't thank you now. And there's something you can help me with.""

My arm was still lightly around her waist, feeling her body tremble. I responded to her plea as much as her words when I said, ""Certainly."" She gave me an address south of Inferno, an apartment number, and a time. She asked for my name, and I told her.

""Hey, you!""

I turned to the policeman's shout. He waved away the small crowd of masked women and bare-faced men. Coughing from the smoke the car left, he asked for my papers. I handed him the important ones.

He looked at them and then at me. ""British Barter? How long will you be in New York?""

Suppressing the urge to say, ""For as short a time as possible,"" I told him I'd be here for a week or so.

""May need you as a witness,"" he explained. ""Those kids can't use smoke on us. When they do that, we pull them in.""

He seemed to think the smoke was the worst part. ""They tried to kill the lady,"" I pointed out.

He shook his head wisely. ""They always pretend they're going to, but actually they just want to snag skirts. I've picked up rippers with as many as fifty skirt-snags tacked up in their rooms. Of course, sometimes they come a little too close.""

I explained that if I hadn't pulled her out of the way, she'd have been hit by more than hooks. But he interrupted, ""If she'd thought it was a real murder attempt, she'd have stayed here.""

I looked around. It was true. She was gone.

""She was really scared,"" I told him.

""Who wouldn't be? Those kids would have scared even Stalin.""

""I mean she was scared of more than 'kids.' They didn't look like 'kids.'""

""What did they look like?""

I tried without much success to describe the three faces. A vague impression of meanness and softness doesn't mean much.

""Well, I could be wrong,"" he said finally. ""Do you know the girl? Where she lives?""

""No,"" I half-lied.

The other policeman hung up his radio and walked over, kicking at the smoke as it thinned. The black cloud no longer hid the burnt buildings, and I could start to see the distant stub of the Empire State Building, sticking up out of Inferno like a broken finger.

""They haven't been caught so far,"" the other policeman grumbled. ""Left smoke for five blocks, from what Ryan says.""

The first policeman shook his head. ""That's bad,"" he said seriously.

I was feeling a bit uneasy and ashamed. An Englishman shouldn't lie, at least not without thinking.

""They sound like nasty people,"" the first policeman continued in the same serious tone. ""We'll need witnesses. Looks like you may have to stay in New York longer than you expect.""

I got the point. I said, ""I forgot to show you all my papers,"" and handed him a few others, making sure there was a five-dollar bill tucked in.

When he handed them back a bit later, his voice was no longer threatening. My feelings of guilt disappeared. To strengthen our new friendship, I chatted with the two of them about their job.

""I suppose the masks give you some trouble,"" I observed. ""Over in England, we've been reading about your new crop of masked female bandits.""

""Those things get exaggerated,"" the first policeman assured me. ""It's the men masking as women that really mix us up. But, brother, when we catch them, we jump on them with both feet.""

""And you get so you can spot women almost as well as if they had naked faces,"" the second policeman said. ""You know, from their hands and all that.""

""Especially all that,"" the first agreed with a chuckle. ""Say, is it true that some girls don't mask over in England?""

""A number of them have picked up the fashion,"" I told him. ""Only a few, though—the ones who always adopt the latest style, however extreme.""

""They're usually masked in the British newscasts.""

""I imagine it's arranged that way out of respect for American tastes,"" I confessed. ""Actually, not very many do mask.""

The second policeman thought about that. ""Girls going down the street bare from the neck up."" It wasn't clear whether he liked the idea or not. Probably both.

""A few members keep trying to persuade Parliament to pass a law forbidding all masking,"" I continued, talking perhaps a bit too much.

The second policeman shook his head. ""What an idea. You know, masks are a pretty good thing, brother. Couple of years more and I'm going to make my wife wear hers around the house.""

The first policeman shrugged. ""If women were to stop wearing masks, in six weeks you wouldn't know the difference. You get used to anything if enough people do or don't do it.""

I agreed, rather sadly, and left them. I turned north on Broadway (I think it's old Tenth Avenue) and walked quickly until I was beyond Inferno. Passing such an area of untreated radioactivity always makes a person uneasy. I thanked God there weren't any such in England, yet.

The street was almost empty, though I was approached by a couple of beggars with faces marked by H-bomb scars, whether real or of makeup putty, I couldn't tell. A fat woman held out a baby with webbed fingers and toes. I told myself it would have been deformed anyway and that she was only making money off our fear of bomb-induced mutations. Still, I gave her a seven-and-a-half-cent piece. Her mask made me feel I was paying tribute to an African idol.

""May all your children be blessed with one head and two eyes, sir.""

""Thanks,"" I said, shuddering, and hurried past her.

This last was the end of an anti-sex song being sung by some religious people half a block from the circle-and-cross sign of a femalist temple. They reminded me only faintly of our small group of British monks. Above their heads was a jumble of billboards advertising pre-digested foods, wrestling instruction, radio handies, and the like.

I stared at the hysterical slogans with disagreeable fascination. Since the female face and form have been banned on American signs, the very letters of the advertiser's alphabet have begun to crawl with sex—the fat-bellied, big-breasted capital B, the seductive double O. However, I reminded myself, it is mainly the mask that so strangely emphasizes sex in America.

A British anthropologist has pointed out that, while it took more than 5,000 years to shift the main point of sexual interest from the hips to the breasts, the next transition to the face has taken less than 50 years. Comparing the American style with Muslim tradition isn't valid; Muslim women are forced to wear veils, which are meant to hide, while American women have only the compulsion of fashion and use masks to create mystery.

Theory aside, the actual origins of the trend are to be found in the anti-radiation clothing of World War III, which led to masked wrestling, now a hugely popular sport, and that in turn led to the current female fashion. Only a wild style at first, masks quickly became as necessary as bras and lipsticks had been earlier in the century.

I finally realized that I was not speculating about masks in general, but about what lay behind one in particular. That's the tricky thing about them; you're never sure whether a girl is heightening beauty or hiding ugliness. I pictured a cool, pretty face in which fear showed only in widened eyes. Then I remembered her blonde hair, rich against the blackness of the satin mask. She'd told me to come at the twenty-second hour—ten p.m.

I climbed to my apartment near the British Consulate; the elevator shaft had been knocked out of line by an old blast, a nuisance in these tall New York buildings. Before it occurred to me that I would be going out again, I automatically tore a tab from the film strip under my shirt. I developed it just to be sure. It showed that the total radiation I'd taken that day was still within the safety limit. I'm not phobic about it, as so many people are these days, but there's no point in taking chances.

I flopped down on the daybed and stared at the silent speaker and the dark screen of the video set. As always, they made me think, somewhat bitterly, of the two great nations of the world. Mutilated by each other, yet still strong, they were crippled giants poisoning the planet with their dreams of an impossible equality and an impossible success.

I fretfully switched on the speaker. By luck, the newscaster was talking excitedly of the prospects of a bumper wheat crop, sown by planes across a dust bowl moistened by seeded rains. I listened carefully to the rest of the program (it was remarkably clear of Russian telejamming) but there was no further news of interest to me. And, of course, no mention of the Moon, though everyone knows that America and Russia are racing to develop their primary bases into fortresses capable of mutual assault and the launching of alphabet-bombs toward Earth. I myself knew perfectly well that the British electronic equipment I was helping trade for American wheat was destined for use in spaceships.

I switched off the newscast. It was growing dark and once again I pictured a tender, frightened face behind a mask. I hadn't had a date since England. It's exceedingly difficult to become acquainted with a girl in America, where as little as a smile, often, can set one of them yelping for the police—to say nothing of the increasing puritanical morality and the roving gangs that keep most women indoors after dark. And naturally, the masks which are definitely not, as the Soviets claim, a last invention of capitalist degeneracy, but a sign of great psychological insecurity. The Russians have no masks, but they have their own signs of stress.

I went to the window and impatiently watched the darkness gather. I was getting very restless. After a while a ghostly violet cloud appeared to the south. My hair rose. Then I laughed. I had momentarily fancied it a radiation from the crater of the Hell-bomb, though I should instantly have known it was only the radio-induced glow in the sky over the amusement and residential area south of Inferno.

Promptly at twenty-two hours I stood before the door of my unknown girl friend's apartment. The electronic say-who-please said just that. I answered clearly, ""Wysten Turner,"" wondering if she'd given my name to the mechanism. She evidently had, for the door opened. I walked into a small empty living room, my heart pounding a bit.

The room was expensively furnished with the latest pneumatic hassocks and sprawlers. There were some midgie books on the table. The one I picked up was the standard hard-boiled detective story in which two female murderers go gunning for each other.

The television was on. A masked girl in green was crooning a love song. Her right hand held something that blurred off into the foreground. I saw the set had a handie, which we haven't in England as yet, and curiously thrust my hand into the handie orifice beside the screen. Contrary to my expectations, it was not like slipping into a pulsing rubber glove, but rather as if the girl on the screen actually held my hand.

A door opened behind me. I jerked out my hand with as guilty a reaction as if I'd been caught peering through a keyhole.

She stood in the bedroom doorway. I think she was trembling. She was wearing a gray fur coat, white-speckled, and a gray velvet evening mask with shirred gray lace around the eyes and mouth. Her fingernails twinkled like silver.

It hadn't occurred to me that she'd expect us to go out.

""I should have told you,"" she said softly. Her mask veered nervously toward the books and the screen and the room's dark corners. ""But I can't possibly talk to you here.""

I said doubtfully, ""There's a place near the Consulate....""

""I know where we can be together and talk,"" she said rapidly. ""If you don't mind.""

As we entered the elevator I said, ""I'm afraid I dismissed the cab.""

But the cab driver hadn't gone for some reason of his own. He jumped out and smirkingly held the front door open for us. I told him we preferred to sit in back. He sulkily opened the rear door, slammed it after us, jumped in front and slammed the door behind him.

My companion leaned forward. ""Heaven,"" she said.

The driver switched on the turbine and televisor.

""Why did you ask if I were a British subject?"" I said, to start the conversation.

She leaned away from me, tilting her mask close to the window. ""See the Moon,"" she said in a quick, dreamy voice.

""But why, really?"" I pressed, conscious of an irritation that had nothing to do with her.

""It's edging up into the purple of the sky.""

""And what's your name?""

""The purple makes it look yellower.""

Just then I became aware of the source of my irritation. It lay in the square of writhing light in the front of the cab beside the driver.

I don't object to ordinary wrestling matches, though they bore me, but I simply detest watching a man wrestle a woman. The fact that the bouts are generally ""on the level,"" with the man greatly outclassed in weight and reach and the masked females young and personable, only makes them seem worse to me.

""Please turn off the screen,"" I requested the driver.

He shook his head without looking around. ""Uh-uh, man,"" he said. ""They've been grooming that babe for weeks for this bout with Little Zirk.""

Infuriated, I reached forward, but my companion caught my arm. ""Please,"" she whispered frightenedly, shaking her head.

I settled back, frustrated. She was closer to me now, but silent and for a few moments I watched the heaves and contortions of the powerful masked girl and her wiry masked opponent on the screen. His frantic scrambling at her reminded me of a male spider.

I jerked around, facing my companion. ""Why did those three men want to kill you?"" I asked sharply.

The eyeholes of her mask faced the screen. ""Because they're jealous of me,"" she whispered.

""Why are they jealous?""

She still didn't look at me. ""Because of him.""

""Who?""

She didn't answer.

I put my arm around her shoulders. ""Are you afraid to tell me?"" I asked. ""What is the matter?""

She still didn't look my way. She smelled nice.

""See here,"" I said laughingly, changing my tactics, ""you really should tell me something about yourself. I don't even know what you look like.""

I half playfully lifted my hand to the band of her neck. She gave it an astonishingly swift slap. I pulled it away in sudden pain. There were four tiny indentations on the back. From one of them a tiny bead of blood welled out as I watched. I looked at her silver fingernails and saw they were actually delicate and pointed metal caps.

""I'm dreadfully sorry,"" I heard her say, ""but you frightened me. I thought for a moment you were going to....""

At last she turned to me. Her coat had fallen open. Her evening dress was Cretan Revival, a bodice of lace beneath and supporting the breasts without covering them.

""Don't be angry,"" she said, putting her arms around my neck. ""You were wonderful this afternoon.""

The soft gray velvet of her mask, molding itself to her cheek, pressed mine. Through the mask's lace the wet warm tip of her tongue touched my chin.

""I'm not angry,"" I said. ""Just puzzled and anxious to help.""

The cab stopped. To either side were black windows bordered by spears of broken glass. The sickly purple light showed a few ragged figures slowly moving toward us.

The driver muttered, ""It's the turbine, man. We're grounded."" He sat there hunched and motionless. ""Wish it had happened somewhere else.""

My companion whispered, ""Five dollars is the usual amount.""

She looked out so shudderingly at the congregating figures that I suppressed my indignation and did as she suggested. The driver took the bill without a word. As he started up, he put his hand out the window and I heard a few coins clink on the pavement.

My companion came back into my arms, but her mask faced the television screen, where the tall girl had just pinned the convulsively kicking Little Zirk.

""I'm so frightened,"" she breathed.

Heaven turned out to be an equally ruinous neighborhood, but it had a club with an awning and a huge doorman uniformed like a spaceman, but in gaudy colors. In my sensuous daze I rather liked it all. We stepped out of the cab just as a drunken old woman came down the sidewalk, her mask awry. A couple ahead of us turned their heads from the half-revealed face, as if from an ugly body at the beach. As we followed them in I heard the doorman say, ""Get along, grandma, and watch yourself.""

Inside, everything was dimness and blue glows. She had said we could talk here, but I didn't see how. Besides the inevitable chorus of sneezes and coughs (they say America is fifty percent allergic these days), there was a band going full blast in the latest robop style, in which an electronic composing machine selects an arbitrary sequence of tones into which the musicians weave their raucous little individualities.

Most of the people were in booths. The band was behind the bar. On a small platform beside them, a girl was dancing, stripped to her mask. The little cluster of men at the shadowy far end of the bar weren't looking at her.

We inspected the menu in gold script on the wall and pushed the buttons for breast of chicken, fried shrimps and two scotches. Moments later, the serving bell tinkled. I opened the gleaming panel and took out our drinks.

The cluster of men at the bar filed off toward the door, but first they stared around the room. My companion had just thrown back her coat. Their look lingered on our booth. I noticed that there were three of them.

The band chased off the dancing girl with growls. I handed my companion a straw and we sipped our drinks.

""You wanted me to help you about something,"" I said. ""Incidentally, I think you're lovely.""

She nodded quick thanks, looked around, leaned forward. ""Would it be hard for me to get to England?""

""No,"" I replied, a bit taken aback. ""Provided you have an American passport.""

""Are they difficult to get?""

""Rather,"" I said, surprised at her lack of information. ""Your country doesn't like its nationals to travel, though it isn't quite as stringent as Russia.""

""Could the British Consulate help me get a passport?""

""It's hardly their....""

""Could you?""

I realized we were being inspected. A man and two girls had paused opposite our table. The girls were tall and wolfish-looking, with spangled masks. The man stood jauntily between them like a fox on its hind legs.

My companion didn't glance at them, but she sat back. I noticed that one of the girls had a big yellow bruise on her forearm. After a moment they walked to a booth in the deep shadows.

""Know them?"" I asked. She didn't reply. I finished my drink. ""I'm not sure you'd like England,"" I said. ""The austerity's altogether different from your American brand of misery.""

She leaned forward again. ""But I must get away,"" she whispered.

""Why?"" I was getting impatient.

""Because I'm so frightened.""

There were chimes. I opened the panel and handed her the fried shrimps. The sauce on my breast of chicken was a delicious steaming compound of almonds, soy and ginger. But something must have been wrong with the radionic oven that had thawed and heated it, for at the first bite I crunched a kernel of ice in the meat. These delicate mechanisms need constant repair and there aren't enough mechanics.

I put down my fork. ""What are you really scared of?"" I asked her.

For once her mask didn't waver away from my face. As I waited I could feel the fears gathering without her naming them, tiny dark shapes swarming through the curved night outside, converging on the radioactive pest spot of New York, dipping into the margins of the purple. I felt a sudden rush of sympathy, a desire to protect the girl opposite me. The warm feeling added itself to the infatuation engendered in the cab.

""Everything,"" she said finally.

I nodded and touched her hand.

""I'm afraid of the Moon,"" she began, her voice going dreamy and brittle as it had in the cab. ""You can't look at it and not think of guided bombs.""

""It's the same Moon over England,"" I reminded her.

""But it's not England's Moon any more. It's ours and Russia's. You're not responsible.""

I pressed her hand.

""Oh, and then,"" she said with a tilt of her mask, ""I'm afraid of the cars and the gangs and the loneliness and Inferno. I'm afraid of the lust that undresses your face. And--"" her voice hushed--""I'm afraid of the wrestlers.""

""Yes?"" I prompted softly after a moment.

Her mask came forward. ""Do you know something about the wrestlers?"" she asked rapidly. ""The ones that wrestle women, I mean. They often lose, you know. And then they have to have a girl to take their frustration out on. A girl who's soft and weak and terribly frightened. They need that, to keep them men. Other men don't want them to have a girl. Other men want them just to fight women and be heroes. But they must have a girl. It's horrible for her.""

I squeezed her fingers tighter, as if courage could be transmitted—granting I had any. ""I think I can get you to England,"" I said.

Shadows crawled onto the table and stayed there. I looked up at the three men who had been at the end of the bar. They were the men I had seen in the big coupe. They wore black sweaters and close-fitting black trousers. Their faces were as expressionless as dopers. Two of them stood above me. The other loomed over the girl.

""Drift off, man,"" I was told. I heard the other inform the girl: ""We'll wrestle a fall, sister. What shall it be? Judo, slapsie or kill-who-can?""

I stood up. There are times when an Englishman simply must be maltreated. But just then the foxlike man came gliding in like the star of a ballet. The reaction of the other three startled me. They were acutely embarrassed.

He smiled at them thinly. ""You won't win my favor by tricks like this,"" he said.

""Don't get the wrong idea, Zirk,"" one of them pleaded.

""I will if it's right,"" he said. ""She told me what you tried to do this afternoon. That won't endear you to me, either. Drift.""

They backed off awkwardly. ""Let's get out of here,"" one of them said loudly, as they turned. ""I know a place where they fight naked with knives.""

Little Zirk laughed musically and slipped into the seat beside my companion. She shrank from him, just a little. I pushed my feet back, leaned forward.

""Who's your friend, baby?"" he asked, not looking at her.

She passed the question to me with a little gesture. I told him.

""British,"" he observed. ""She's been asking you about getting out of the country? About passports?"" He smiled pleasantly. ""She likes to start running away. Don't you, baby?"" His small hand began to stroke her wrist, the fingers bent a little, the tendons ridged, as if he were about to grab and twist.

""Look here,"" I said sharply. ""I have to be grateful to you for ordering off those bullies, but—""

""Think nothing of it,"" he told me. ""They're no harm except when they're behind steering wheels. A well-trained fourteen-year-old girl could cripple any one of them. Why, even Theda here, if she went in for that sort of thing...."" He turned to her, shifting his hand from her wrist to her hair. He stroked it, letting the strands slip slowly through his fingers. ""You know I lost tonight, baby, don't you?"" he said softly.

I stood up. ""Come along,"" I said to her. ""Let's leave.""

She just sat there. I couldn't even tell if she was trembling. I tried to read a message in her eyes through the mask.

""I'll take you away,"" I said to her. ""I can do it. I really will.""

He smiled at me. ""She'd like to go with you,"" he said. ""Wouldn't you, baby?""

""Will you or won't you?"" I said to her. She still just sat there.

He slowly knotted his fingers in her hair.

""Listen, you little vermin,"" I snapped at him, ""Take your hands off her.""

He came up from the seat like a snake. I'm no fighter. I just know that the more scared I am, the harder and straighter I hit. This time I was lucky. But as he crumpled back, I felt a slap and four stabs of pain in my cheek. I clapped my hand to it. I could feel the four gashes made by her dagger finger caps, and the warm blood oozing out from them.

She didn't look at me. She was bending over little Zirk and cuddling her mask to his cheek and crooning: ""There, there, don't feel bad, you'll be able to hurt me afterward.""

There were sounds around us, but they didn't come close. I leaned forward and ripped the mask from her face.

I really don't know why I should have expected her face to be anything else. It was very pale, of course, and there weren't any cosmetics. I suppose there's no point in wearing any under a mask. The eyebrows were untidy and the lips chapped. But as for the general expression, as for the feelings crawling and wriggling across it—

Have you ever lifted a rock from damp soil? Have you ever watched the slimy white grubs?

I looked down at her, she up at me. ""Yes, you're so frightened, aren't you?"" I said sarcastically. ""You dread this little nightly drama, don't you? You're scared to death.""

And I walked right out into the purple night, still holding my hand to my bleeding cheek. No one stopped me, not even the girl wrestlers. I wished I could tear a tab from under my shirt, and test it then and there, and find I'd taken too much radiation, and so be able to ask to cross the Hudson and go down New Jersey, past the lingering radiance of the Narrows Bomb, and so on to Sandy Hook to wait for the rusty ship that would take me back over the seas to England.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around themes of fear, deception, and societal decay in a post-apocalyptic world. The protagonist, Wysten Turner, an Englishman visiting New York, becomes entangled in a mysterious and dangerous situation involving a masked girl who seeks his help. This girl appears to be in fear for her life, pursued by a group of men with sinister motives. The protagonist is drawn in by her apparent vulnerability and his own desire to help, while also grappling with the unsettling environment of a dystopian America, where societal norms have shifted dramatically.

The tension escalates as Turner becomes aware of the strange and menacing social dynamics at play—masked identities, gender conflicts, and a culture of violence and fear. The girl's request for help in escaping the country and the subsequent revelation of her involvement with a dangerous man, Little Zirk, complicates the narrative, blurring the lines between victim and participant.

Ultimately, the protagonist faces a moral and emotional conflict: the desire to help the girl, driven by a mix of chivalry and infatuation, clashes with the harsh reality of her true nature and the world she inhabits. This internal struggle is exacerbated by the external chaos of a society plagued by fear, corruption, and the lingering effects of war. The story ends with Turner disillusioned and yearning to return to the relative safety and normalcy of England, highlighting the overarching theme of seeking refuge from a world that has lost its moral compass.",Imagine a world where even a smile could get you in trouble.

001.txt,"George H. Cutter drove his big convertible into his reserved parking spot with style. The bright California sun was shining as he walked toward the square, four-story brick building with ""Cutter Products, Inc."" over the door. A two-ton truck was backing up toward the loading doors, the driver looking back carefully. Cutter moved quickly, a strong man even though he wasn't very tall. He noticed Kurt, the truck driver, skillfully fitting the truck into a tight spot.

""Move that junk out of the way!"" Cutter yelled over the noise of the truck's engine.

Kurt turned his head, his blue eyes narrowing, then recognized Cutter and smiled. ""All right, sir,"" he said. ""Just a second while I get out and I'll move it.""

""With bare hands?"" Cutter asked.

""With bare hands,"" Kurt replied.

Cutter laughed loudly and hit the front fender of the truck with his fist. Kurt laughed back.

Cutter liked joking roughly with Kurt and the other truck drivers. They were simple and didn't have his mental strength, but they had a different kind of strength: muscle, energy, and guts. Twenty years ago, Cutter had been a truck driver too. The drivers knew that, so there was a bond between them that was rare between an employer and employees.

The guard at the door stood up straight, and Cutter nodded quickly. Instead of taking the stairs to his office on the second floor, he walked through the shop on the first floor. He always did this because he liked the sound of the machines and the look of the men in their work clothes. There was strength here, in the machines and the men.

The bond between Cutter and his workers was as real as the noise of the machines and the metal dust flying from the saw blades. He could connect with them despite unions and their dislike of business suits and clean hands because they knew he had once been a machinist and shop foreman. They respected him and were inspired by his energy and confidence. This was one reason why their production was always near the top in efficiency.

Cutter turned and went up the stairs to the second floor quickly, his sturdy figure moving smoothly without getting out of breath. Coming up the back stairs meant he had to walk through the entire administration office, where the people of Production Control, Procurement, and Purchasing worked. Here, his good mood from the walk through the shop faded a bit.

On both sides of him as he walked quickly across the room were rows of desks with the kind of men he didn't like: fragile men, whether they were thin or fat, they were weak in the eyes and mouth, and pale. They pretended to be tough behind those desks, but Cutter knew it was just an act. They were a kind of people he didn't understand because he had never been one of them, and so the relationship between employer and employee was cold and brittle here, like frozen plastic.

The sounds here—the typing, the file drawers sliding, the squeak of chairs—all annoyed him, instead of inspiring him, so he hurried through, especially when he passed a man with sad, scared eyes, who touched the papers on his desk carefully, like a shy deer testing the ground. What was his name? Linden? Cutter thought he was the perfect example of the type: pale, slow, and so timid he seemed ready to jump at the slightest noise.

Cutter broke his aloofness long enough to glare at the man, and Linden quickly looked down at his desk and shuffled his papers nervously. Some day, Cutter promised himself, he would stop in front of the man and shout, ""Boo!"" and scare him out of his wits.

He pushed open the glass doors to his own office, and moving into Lucile's reception area brought back his good mood. Lucile, motherly yet lively, smiled at him and looked him in the eyes. Here was strength again, and he felt his energy return. Lucile, behind her desk in the nice reception room, reminded him of fast, hard efficiency, which he valued.

""Great morning, isn't it, Lucy?"" he called.

""Beautiful, George,"" she said. She had called him by his first name for years. He didn't mind it from her. Not many could do it, but those who could do it well, he respected.

""What's up first?"" he asked, and she followed him into his office. It was a high-ceilinged room, with bare walls except for a picture of Alexander Hamilton and an award plaque. He turned his chair toward him and sat down, placing his strong hands on the desk. Lucile took the only other chair in the office and opened her appointment book.

""Quay wants to see you right away. Says it's important.""

Cutter nodded and closed his eyes. Lucile continued listing his appointments for the day with quick precision. He remembered each, getting ready for a busy day.

""That's it,"" Lucile said. ""Do you want to see Quay?""

""Send him in,"" Cutter said, already signing letters he had dictated the day before.

Lucile left, and three minutes later Robert Quay sat in the chair beside Cutter's desk. Quay was taller and thinner than Cutter, but there was a grace and confidence about him. He was single and only thirty-five, twelve years younger than Cutter, but he had been with Cutter Products, Inc. for thirteen years. In college, he had been a top student and a star quarterback. He was the kind of rare talent Cutter liked, and Cutter had offered him more than a professional football team to get him after graduation.

Cutter felt Quay's presence without looking up. ""Great morning, isn't it, Bob?""

""It really is, George,"" Quay said.

""What's up?"" Cutter stopped signing and looked directly at Quay, who met his gaze confidently.

""I've got a report from Sid Perry at Adacam Research.""

""Your inside man again, eh?""

Quay grinned. Adacam Research did industrial experiments, including government work. The only way to find out what went on there was to find a key person who didn't mind talking for a price, despite oaths and government agreements. You could always find someone, Cutter knew, and Quay had found a young chemist, Sidney Perry.

""Okay,"" Cutter said. ""What are they doing over there?""

""There's a guy who's offered Adacam his project for testing. They're interested, but they're not going to handle it.""

""Why not?""

Quay shrugged. ""Too controversial. It's an electronic device—""

""What's controversial about electronics?""

""This deals with human personality,"" Quay said, as if that explained everything.

Cutter understood. ""Anything that deals with human personality scares them over there, doesn't it?""

Quay spread his hands.

""All right,"" Cutter said. ""What's this device supposed to do?""

""The theory is to produce energy units that affect the human ego.""

""Will it?"" Cutter never wasted time on surprise or curiosity. Would it work or not? Efficiency versus inefficiency. Would it improve production at Cutter Products, Inc. or not?

""Sid says they're convinced it will. The numbers check out on paper. But there's been no testing because it involves human personality. It's supposed to change the personality of the person using it.""

""How?""

""You know the theory of shock treatment in psychiatry? The effect is similar but much more effective.""

""What is the effect?""

""Getting rid of feelings of inferiority or inhibitions. A clear mind. A healthy ego.""

""And?""

""Confidence.""

Cutter stared at Quay, taking in the information. ""That's nice. Now where does it fit with Cutter Products?""

Quay took out a notebook. ""You remember that efficiency check we did two months ago—the rating of departments on comparable work produced?""

Cutter nodded.

Quay looked at his notebook. ""All administrative departments showed an average of—""

""Thirty-six point eight less efficiency than skilled and unskilled labor departments,"" Cutter finished.

Quay smiled and closed the notebook. ""Right. That's our efficiency problem.""

""I've known that for twenty years,"" Cutter said.

""Okay,"" Quay said, getting serious again. ""We submitted this efficiency report for analysis, and they offered no solution because they said you always get that ratio due to personality differences. Administrative staff have more feelings of inferiority, thus less confidence, thus less efficiency.""

""I remember all that,"" Cutter said.

""The report also said this efficiency loss is balanced by smaller wages. Administrative staff earn about twenty-five percent less than skilled labor, and the remaining efficiency loss is made up by unskilled labor earning about the same as administrative staff.""

""I remember that nonsense too,"" Cutter said, annoyed. He didn't believe the statistics were nonsense, only that accepting a thirty-six point eight efficiency loss was wrong. A loss in efficiency was a loss in profits. ""And this is supposed to fix it?""

Quay nodded. ""It's worth a try. I've talked to Sid, and he says Bolen, who developed this thing, would install enough units for the entire administrative staff, from department heads down.""

""How?""

""It's no bigger than a thick saucer. It could go inside the chairs."" Quay smiled. ""They sit on it, you see, and—""

Cutter wasn't amused. ""How much?""

""Nothing,"" Quay said quickly. ""Absolutely nothing. Bolen wants real tests, and the Institute wouldn't do it. Give him 150 people to work on, and it's yours for free. He'll install it, and he wants to keep it secret to get accurate results. For him, it's perfect because we're doing a continuous efficiency check, and if it works, we'll gain all the benefits for nothing. How can we lose?""

Cutter stared at Quay, his mind working fast. ""Call Horner in on this, but nobody else. Absolutely nobody else. Tell Horner to write up a contract for Bolen to sign. Get a clause saying Bolen is responsible for any effects not listed in the contract. Make him fully liable, then get it signed, and let's see what happens.""

Quay smiled and stood up. ""Right, sir."" He knew he had done a good job. This was the kind of thing that would keep him in Cutter's favor. ""Right, George,"" he said, remembering he didn't need to call Cutter ""sir"" anymore, but he knew Cutter wouldn't say more because Cutter was already looking at a blueprint, his mind on a new problem.

Edward Bolen called the saucer-sized disk the Confidet. He was a thin, short, smiling man with fine brown hair that looked windblown, and he moved with quick, sure motions. As he installed the disks two nights after Cutter's lawyer got the contract signed, only Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were there.

Bolen fitted the disks into the chair cushions and explained as he worked, ""The energy is inside each one. It lasts indefinitely, and the amount used depends on the demand created.""

""What do you mean by energy?"" Cutter asked, watching Bolen work.

Bolen laughed happily, and Quay was embarrassed for anyone laughing at Cutter's question. But Cutter didn't react, only looked at Bolen, as if he could see strength beneath the small man's calmness. Quay had seen that look on Cutter's face before, and it meant Cutter would wait, analyzing until he found his advantage. Quay wondered if this gadget worked, how long Bolen would own the rights.

Cutter drove his Cadillac out of the city and into the hills, heading to the exclusive Green Oaks area. Ten minutes later, he arrived at his massive stone house, which looked like it came from a medieval castle. Capra, his handyman, took the car as Cutter went up the steps to the door.

Niels took his hat, and Mary was waiting for him in the library. She was a large woman, not fat, and when she wore high heels—though she rarely did because she believed in treating others how she wanted to be treated—she was an inch taller than Cutter. She was pleasant and cooperative, and the one thing that bothered Cutter was her inability to face life with strength.

She worried about others' feelings and thoughts, so Cutter wondered if she had any personal convictions. Yet her weakness was also an advantage because she constantly tried to make him happy. The house was run perfectly, the servants liked her, and things got done for her, so Cutter had no real complaints. Someday, he knew, he would help her reach her full potential, and then there wouldn't be even that one annoyance about her.

He sat in a large, worn leather chair, and she handed him a Scotch and water, kissed his cheek, and sat in a smaller chair. ""Did you have a nice day, dear?"" she asked.

She was always pleasant and smiled at him. They had been married five years, and she was almost fifteen years younger than him, but they understood each other. She respected his work, was careful with money, and never forgot the Scotch and water. ""The day was all right,"" he said.

""My goodness,"" she said, ""you worked late. Do you want dinner right away?""

""I had sandwiches at the office,"" he said, sipping his drink.

""That isn't enough,"" she said, concerned, which he enjoyed. ""You should have some roast beef Andre made perfectly, and I made a wonderful dressing for a small salad.""

He smiled. ""All right,"" he said.

She kissed him again and went to prepare dinner, and he relaxed in the chair, sipping his drink. He felt content. The Confidet would fix the last efficiency problem, and then he might expand his business. He closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying his contentment, then heard dinner being set and got up, realizing he was hungry. Not only hungry, he thought, but maybe he'd make love to Mary that evening.

The first sign that the Confidet might be working came three weeks later when Quay gave Cutter a report showing a 3.7 percent efficiency increase. ""I think that should tell the story,"" Quay said excitedly.

""Doesn't mean anything,"" Cutter said. ""Could be a thousand other factors besides that gadget.""

""But we've never seen more than a 1.5 variance on administrative checks.""

""The trouble with you, Quay,"" Cutter said, ""is you expect miracles. You think hoping hard gets things done. Nothing comes easy, and I'm tempted to have those silly things removed."" He bent over his work, finished with Quay, and Quay left, deflated.

Cutter smiled to himself. He liked breaking Quay's enthusiasm sometimes. It molded a good man because getting knocked down and getting up made him stronger. Cutter wasn't unhappy about the efficiency figures and knew they were significant.

Give it another two weeks, he thought, and if the increase was similar, they might have a real improvement. Those timid people at the desks might start earning their keep. He was thinking about that when Lucile opened his door, and he caught a glimpse of the office outside, including the clerk with the sad, frightened eyes. Even you, Linden, Cutter thought, we might even improve you.

The increase was similar after two more weeks, reaching 8.9 percent. Quay was too excited to be discouraged, and Cutter couldn't hide his pleasure.

""This is really it, George,"" Quay said. ""It really is. And here."" He handed Cutter some figures. ""Here's what accounting estimates the profit will be on this 8.9 percent.""

Cutter nodded, his eyes narrowing. ""We won't see that for a while.""

""No,"" Quay said, ""but we'll see it! We'll sure as hell see it! And if it goes much higher, we'll balance out!""

""What does Bolen say the top is?""

""Ten percent.""

""Why not thirty-six point eight?"" Cutter said, his eyes bright.

Quay whistled. ""Even at ten, with the wages we're paying—""

""Never settle for quarters or thirds,"" Cutter said. ""Get the whole thing. Send for Bolen. I want to talk to him. And in the meantime, Bob, this is such a great morning, how about we go to lunch early?""

Quay blinked only once, proving his adaptability. Cutter had just asked him to lunch as if it were normal, though Quay had never lunched with Cutter before. Quay said, ""Why, fine, George. I think that's a good idea.""

Bolen came to Cutter's office the next morning, smiling, his eyes quickly taking in Cutter's desk and walls, making Cutter feel like the man was looking into his brain.

""Quay tells me you've set ten percent as the top efficiency increase, Bolen,"" Cutter said directly.

Bolen smiled, studying Cutter's hands and suit and eyes. ""That's right, Mr. Cutter.""

""Why?""

Bolen put his small hands on his lap, looked at his fingers, then up at Cutter again. He kept smiling. ""It's a matter of saturation.""

""How can ten percent more efficiency become saturation?""

""Not ten percent more efficiency,"" Bolen said quietly. ""Ten percent effect on the individual creating the efficiency. Ten percent effect of what makes him ten percent more efficient.""

Cutter snorted. ""Whatever that gadget does, it creates confidence, drive, strength, doesn't it? Isn't that what you said?""

""Yes,"" Bolen said politely. ""Approximately.""

""Can you explain how ten percent more confidence in a person is saturation?""

Bolen spoke slowly, still smiling. ""Some people are different than others, Mr. Cutter. Some people react to personality changes differently. Are you concerned about what those changes might have done to individuals?""

""Hell, no,"" Cutter said loudly. ""Why should I be? I'm interested in efficiency. Tell me about efficiency, and I'll know what you're talking about.""

""All right,"" Bolen said. ""We don't know which people have been affected more. All we have is an average. The average now is 8.9 percent. But maybe some workers don't react because they don't have the lacks or inhibitions the Confidet deals with. Maybe they're working at top efficiency, and no more exposure to the Confidet will change them.""

""All right then,"" Cutter said quickly, ""we'll find that kind of deadwood and replace them!""

""How will you know which are deadwood?"" Bolen asked pleasantly.

""Individual checks, of course!""

Bolen shook his head. ""It won't necessarily work. The work these men do isn't demanding, is it? You want a balance between capability and demand. It's the imbalance that's trouble, and in your case, demand outweighed capability. Now, if you get a ten percent increase, you're balanced. If you go over that, you'll break the balance again, with capability outweighing demand.""

""Good,"" Cutter said. ""Any man whose capability outweighs his work will keep increasing efficiency.""

Bolen shook his head. ""No. He'll lose interest, because the work won't challenge him, and efficiency will drop.""

Cutter's jaw hardened. ""All right. I'll move him up and fill his place with someone else.""

Bolen looked at Cutter's eyes, studying them curiously. ""Some men have a lot of hidden talent, Mr. Cutter. This talent released—""

Cutter frowned, studying Bolen carefully. He laughed suddenly. ""You think I might not handle it?""

""Well, say you have gentle mares, and you turn them into thoroughbreds. You have to make allowances. The same stalls, railings, stable boys might not do the job.""

""Yes,"" Cutter said, smiling without humor, ""but the owner isn't concerned with stalls and railings and stable boys, only that they are secondary. The owner is the owner, and if he has to make changes, fine. But nothing really affects the owner, whether gentle mares or thoroughbreds.""

Bolen nodded, as if expecting that answer. ""You are a certain man, aren't you, Mr. Cutter?""

""Would I be here, in this office, heading this company, if I weren't, Bolen?""

Bolen smiled.

Cutter straightened in his chair. ""Do we go on? Do we shoot for the limit?""

Bolen chose his words carefully. ""I'm interested in testing my Confidet, Mr. Cutter. It's most important to me. I don't recommend what you want to do. But, if you'll give me accurate reports on the Confidet's effects, I'll go along. Providing you grant one concession.""

Cutter frowned.

""I want our contract dissolved.""

Cutter reddened. Nobody demanded from him easily, but he thought of the efficiency increase, the profit increase. He wouldn't stop with administrative staff. Other departments could use sharpening. Finally, he nodded. ""All right, Bolen.""

Bolen smiled and left quickly, and Cutter stared at his desk, tense. Then he relaxed, his face softening. He looked at a date circled on his calendar and grinned, picking up the phone.

""This is George H. Cutter,"" he said. ""My wife's birthday is next Saturday. Remember that antique desk I bought her last year? Well, she uses it all the time, so this year I'd like a chair to match it. She's using an occasional chair now...""

Mary loved the gift, and after her birthday, Cutter found her at the desk, using the chair, running her house and staff. The improvement in her was noticeable almost immediately. Within a month, she held a dinner for thirty people without crying before it started.

There were other changes.

Quay brought report after report, and after three months, efficiency reached 18.7 percent. The administrative office was no longer dull and listless; it thrived like the shop below. Cutter saw the difference, especially in certain individuals.

Brown and Kennedy improved, but Harry Linden amazed Cutter. An individual check showed a 60 percent increase, and Linden looked different. He walked with a quick, strong step, and his face and eyes were alive. He started working early and late, and only missed work for a divorce trial.

Within a month, Cutter fired Stole, Lackter, and Grant as department heads and replaced them with Brown, Kennedy, and Linden. He planned to install Confidets in drafting and supply departments, and profits from increased efficiency showed in records. Cutter was full of new enthusiasm and ambition, but there was one problem.

Quay had resigned.

Cutter was shocked and angry, but Quay was unbothered. ""I've enjoyed working here, George, but my mind is made up. No hard feelings?""

Cutter didn't shake his hand.

He was bothered for days, checking every industrial company to see where Quay went. He was surprised to learn Quay bought a small boat and carried fishermen onto the Bay. Quay also married four days after resigning, and Cutter dismissed it as partial insanity.

By February, he promoted Harry Linden to Quay's job, got rid of obvious deadwood, and total efficiency averaged 33 percent. On his and Mary's anniversary, March fourth, he was sure he could expand to another plant.

He was about to order her a mink stole but learned she was suing for divorce. He rushed home, furious, but she was gone, taking her clothes, jewelry, and second Cadillac. She left her desk and chair. After the trial, she won enough support to go to France, where she bought a chateau.

He tried to lose himself in work but began to worry. It was only a hint of worry, but it stopped him from expanding. Stocks in the company turned over rapidly, and though it was just intuition, he readied himself to meet anything.

The explosion came in July.

Drindor Products picked up 49 percent of the stock using secondary buyers. There had been a leak, Cutter realized, telling his competitor, Drindor, about his profits. He knew who it was instantly, but before he could fire Harry Linden, his world collapsed. Four months earlier, to boost Linden's morale, he let Linden have eight of his shares, intending to buy them back later. Linden and Drindor worked together. Cutter lost control.

A board of directors was elected by Drindor, and Drindor assumed the presidency by proxy. Harry Linden took over Cutter's office as Vice President In Charge.

Cutter had ordered Bolen to remove the Confidets a week before, but he knew it was too late, and Bolen's knowing smile infuriated him. Bolen calmly carried the disks away. When Cutter left his office for the last time, he moved slowly.

He brooded for days, searching for a way to fight back. He still had enough stock to live comfortably for a hundred years, but he no longer had power, and he wanted it back. He thought about how to regain control of the company he built with his own hands and mind.

He paced the library, living room, and dining room, lost in thought, until he saw the desk and chair through the sewing room doorway and remembered he hadn't dealt with it.

He paused briefly, then removed the disk and carried it to the library, fitting it under the large leather chair cushion.

By fall, he had done nothing to regain control and was less sure of what to do. He drove by the plant, looking at it secretly, surprised he didn't want to face Harry Linden. The memory of Linden's firm look, sharp eyes, frightened him, and his fear crushed him. He wished for Mary and wrote pleading letters, but they came back unopened.

Finally, he visited Robert Quay, the only person he felt comfortable talking to. He found Quay in a small cottage near the beach. There was a six-day-old baby in a crib, and Quay's wife was a cheerful girl, making Cutter feel at ease for the first time in weeks.

She left them alone, and Cutter sat there, a little embarrassed but glad to be with Quay. They talked about old times, and finally, Cutter asked:

""I've wondered, Bob, why you left?""

Quay blushed then grinned. ""I might as well admit it. I got one of those things from Bolen and put it in my chair.""

Cutter thought about it, surprised. ""And then you quit?""

""Sure,"" Quay said. ""I always wanted to do what I'm doing now. But things came easy, and the opportunities were always there, and I never had the guts to pass anything by. Finally, I did.""

Quay smiled at him, and Cutter shifted in his chair. ""The Confidet did that.""

Cutter nodded.

It came to him suddenly, something he'd never suspected. There was something wrong with what happened to him. The Confidet affected everyone but him; his must have been faulty. It worked with Mary, but hadn't Bolen said energy was used based on demand? Mary certainly created a demand. Bolen said the life was indefinite, but couldn't the energy have been used up?

""Ah,"" he said carefully, smiling, to Quay. ""You wouldn't have it around, would you? That Confidet of yours?""

""Oh, hell, no,"" Quay said. ""I gave it to Bolen a long time ago. He came for it. Said he had to keep track of all of them.""

Cutter left quickly, with Quay and his wife seeing him out. He drove straight to Bolen's house.

Fury built inside him. Bolen had kept track of his Confidet, knowing Cutter had it. Cutter was furious Bolen used him for experiments and because the Confidet he tried to use was worthless.

All his hatred, all his anger burned inside like hot coals, but he approached Bolen's house quietly.

When he saw Bolen in the doorway, he wanted to hit him, but kept his hands at his sides; and though he hated himself for it, he even smiled a little.

""Come in,"" Bolen smiled, speaking softly, his eyes examining Cutter. ""Come in, Mr. Cutter.""

Cutter wanted to stand there and demand another Confidet, a good one, not walk inside politely like he did. He wanted to speak with the power and hate he once had, but he couldn't say a word.

Bolen was polite. ""You've been using that Confidet, haven't you?"" He spoke gently, like to a frightened child.

""Yes,"" Cutter managed to say.

""And what you expected didn't happen. That's what you want to tell me, isn't it?""

Cutter's insides quivered with rage, but he nodded.

""Would you like to know why?"" Bolen said.

Cutter rubbed his damp palms over his knees. He nodded.

Bolen smiled, his eyes sparkling. ""Very simple. It wasn't the Confidet's fault, Mr. Cutter, but yours. You are a rare exception. What you are, or were, is a complete super ego. There are few of those, Mr. Cutter, but you were one. A complete super ego, and the Confidet's effect was the reverse of what it is with others."" Bolen shook his head, sympathetically, but didn't stop smiling, and his eyes didn't stop studying Cutter. ""It's a shame, because I thought you were a super ego, Mr. Cutter. When you didn't return that Confidet, I felt you might use it, after everything at the company.

""But while I was sure of the effects, Mr. Cutter, I wasn't absolutely sure, and like the other experiments, I had to forget my conscience. I'm really sorry.""

The anger was wild inside Cutter, making his hands tremble, and his mouth quiver, and he hated the man before him, the man responsible for what happened, the smiling man with the soft voice and exploring eyes. But he didn't say anything, not a word. He didn't show his anger, frustration, or resentment. He didn't show Bolen his inner wildness.

He didn't have the nerve.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around George H. Cutter's pursuit of efficiency and control, both in his personal life and his company, and the unintended consequences of his actions. Cutter is a successful businessman who values strength and efficiency, but struggles with understanding and managing the human aspects of his administrative staff. He decides to use a device called the Confidet, which purportedly increases confidence and efficiency by affecting the human ego, to improve productivity in his company.

The dilemma arises from Cutter's decision to use the Confidet without fully understanding its implications. While the device initially seems to increase efficiency, it also fundamentally alters the personalities of the employees, including those closest to him. This leads to unexpected and undesirable outcomes, such as the resignation of his trusted employee, Quay, and the betrayal by Harry Linden, who takes over his company with the help of a competitor.

Furthermore, Cutter's personal life is affected when his wife, Mary, also influenced by a Confidet, gains the confidence to leave him. Cutter's inability to foresee these changes and his refusal to consider the personal and ethical implications of using the Confidet contribute to his downfall.

Ultimately, the story explores themes of power, control, and the limits of technology in manipulating human behavior. Cutter's reliance on the Confidet backfires, as he fails to recognize that true strength and leadership involve understanding and respecting the complexities of human nature, rather than simply trying to enhance efficiency through artificial means.

002.txt,"“Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never know it.”

Those words, said jokingly six months ago in a sunny June garden, came back to Mary Boyne sharply as she stood in the December dusk, waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library.

Her friend Alida Stair had said them while they were having tea at her house, Pangbourne, talking about the very house where Mary now stood. Mary and her husband had come to England looking for a country home, and Alida had suggested Lyng in Dorsetshire. It was remote and lacked modern conveniences, but it was exactly what two romantic Americans like Mary and her husband were looking for.

Mary’s husband, Ned, had laughed at the idea of needing a ghost to complete their dream. But Alida had teased, “Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never know it.”

Mary had laughed with her husband then, but now, standing in the dusk, the words seemed to mean something different. She thought of the empty old house and the silence waiting to be filled with shadows. And she wondered if, perhaps, there was more to Alida's teasing than she thought.

**II**

Mary stood by the window, looking out into the growing darkness. Her husband had gone for a walk, leaving her alone with her thoughts.

Since they’d come to Lyng, Mary had felt a strange connection to the house, as if it held secrets waiting to be discovered. She thought of the village church in their garden, the Tudor architecture that spoke of centuries past, and the stillness that seemed to hold its breath.

Suddenly, Mary felt a chill. She remembered Alida’s words about the ghost and wondered if the house really did have secrets she couldn’t see. Was it possible that Ned had learned something in his solitary walks? But she knew that such things couldn’t be spoken of, and she pushed the thought away.

**III**

One evening, Mary was startled by a visitor. A man had come to see Ned, but she’d never seen him before. He had left no message, only a slip of paper that was now lost. When Ned returned, he seemed distracted by something, but he wouldn’t say what.

Mary felt a growing sense of unease. Something was happening, something she didn’t understand. She thought of the ghost, the secret that Alida had mentioned, and wondered if it was all connected. What if there was something she was missing, something that would only become clear “afterward,” as Alida had said?

The days passed, and Mary felt trapped in a mystery she couldn’t solve. The house seemed alive with whispers, the shadows growing longer as winter deepened. She knew there was more to discover, but she didn’t know how to find it.

**IV**

Weeks later, Mary learned that a man named Elwell had brought a lawsuit against her husband, accusing him of something related to the Blue Star Mine. Ned assured her it was nothing, that the suit had been withdrawn, but Mary couldn’t shake her anxiety. She felt as if she were caught in a web of secrets and lies, unable to find her way out.

As the days grew shorter, Mary watched the shadows lengthen in the old house. She thought of Alida and her teasing words, and wondered if she would ever truly understand the mystery of Lyng. And she realized that, perhaps, she would only know the truth “afterward,” just as Alida had said.

**V**

In the end, Mary never learned the full story. Her husband disappeared without a trace, leaving her alone in the haunted house. She felt the weight of the mystery pressing down on her, but there was nothing she could do. The house held its secrets tightly, and she was left to wonder if she would ever know the truth.

As she sat alone in the library, Mary realized that sometimes the past is best left undisturbed. Some secrets are not meant to be revealed, and some mysteries are meant to remain unsolved. And she understood that Alida had been right all along: some things can only be known “afterward.”

**THE FULNESS OF LIFE**

December 1893

---

**I.**

She lay there, feeling as if she were floating in a warm, calm sea. The pain had stopped for the moment, and she felt as if she were sinking deeper and deeper into a peaceful darkness.

She was not afraid. She had fought against death, but now she felt herself giving in, letting go. She was leaving behind the noise and discomfort of life, the daily worries and struggles. Soon, she thought, she would never have to hear the creaking of her husband’s boots again.

And then she sank deeper into the darkness, feeling herself carried on a gentle tide.

“It is all over,” said the nurse, closing her eyes.

**II.**

She stood at the threshold of a new world. Before her stretched a vast plain, bathed in a soft, glowing light. Mountains rose in the distance, and a river wound its way through the valley. She felt a sense of wonder and joy, as if she were about to discover the secret of life.

She took a step forward, feeling the warmth of the light on her face. “So death is not the end, after all,” she said aloud. “I always knew it couldn’t be.”

And as she spoke, she felt the presence of the Spirit of Life beside her.

“Have you never really known what it is to live?” the Spirit asked.

“No,” she replied. “I have never known the fulness of life.”

“What do you call the fulness of life?” the Spirit asked again.

She hesitated. “I can’t tell you. It’s something you just feel. Love and sympathy are part of it, but so much more.”

The Spirit nodded. “You were married, but you did not find it in your marriage?”

“No,” she said. “My marriage was incomplete.”

“And yet you were fond of your husband?”

“Yes, just as I was fond of my grandmother or my old nurse. But there was so much more I longed for.”

The Spirit asked her to describe those moments when she had felt the fulness of life, and she spoke of a time in Florence, in a church, when she had felt as if all the beauty and mystery of the world were within her reach.

The Spirit listened, then told her, “There is a compensation for such unfulfilled desires.”

“Will I find him?” she cried, overjoyed.

“He is here,” the Spirit answered.

She turned, and there before her stood the one who understood her, who had been waiting for her, just as she had waited for him.

“Are you really he?” she asked.

“I am he,” he replied.

**III**

She took his hand, and together they looked out over the beautiful landscape. “Shall we explore it together?” she asked.

“Yes, I have dreamed of this moment,” he said.

“You too have been searching?”

“All my life,” he replied.

They stood together, feeling the joy of their union. And then he said, “Let us make a home in this beautiful land.”

She hesitated, feeling a shadow pass over her. “Home would not be home to me unless…” she began.

“Unless?” he asked.

She thought of the little things that made her old life familiar, and she realized that she could not leave them behind. She needed them to feel truly at home.

“I can’t go with you,” she said sadly.

“But what will you do?” asked the Spirit.

“I will wait for my husband,” she replied. “He would wait for me.”

The Spirit understood. “You are choosing eternity, remember,” it said.

“I know,” she replied. “But I have all eternity to wait in.”",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story lies in Mary's struggle to uncover the mystery and secrets of the house at Lyng and the implications of her husband's unexplained behavior and ultimate disappearance. This conflict is deeply intertwined with the theme of unknowable truths and the tension between curiosity and acceptance. Mary is haunted by her friend Alida's suggestion that there is a ghost—a metaphor for the hidden secrets within the house and possibly within her marriage—that she will never fully understand. This leads to her sense of unease and entrapment in a web of secrets that she cannot unravel.

The dilemma intensifies as Mary grapples with her husband's distracted behavior, the mysterious visitor, and the lawsuit involving the Blue Star Mine, all of which contribute to her growing anxiety. Ultimately, her husband's disappearance leaves her with unresolved questions and a haunting sense of mystery that she may never solve, echoing Alida's teasing yet prophetic words about only knowing the truth ""afterward.""

In the second narrative, ""The Fulness of Life,"" the conflict shifts to an existential and emotional level, where the protagonist faces a different kind of dilemma. She is at the threshold of a new world, contemplating the essence of life and fulfillment. Despite being offered the chance for perfect union with a kindred spirit, she hesitates because she feels bound by the familiar comforts and memories of her past life, particularly her incomplete but fond relationship with her husband. Here, the dilemma is between choosing an idealized love in the afterlife and honoring the ties of her earthly existence, highlighting themes of loyalty, love, and the complexity of human desires.",Imagine your husband goes for a walk and never comes back.

003.txt,"Ben Tilman sat in a really comfy chair, flipping through a magazine. He was restless, standing up, snapping his fingers, and then sitting back down. He was waiting in a fancy waiting room to see his boss, Mr. Robb, at the end of the day, after hours. Ben was irritated, but he didn’t know why. He had a good life—a nice job, a pretty wife named Betty, and a cute little two-year-old son named Bennie. But for some reason, he wasn’t happy. 

Ben had quit three jobs in the past year, even though they were good jobs and he was doing well. He had worked for Ancestral Insurance and made it to the Billion Dollar Club, but then he felt dissatisfied. He told Betty it was because of too much paperwork, which wasn’t really true. Then he worked for a company that made indoor-outdoor climatizers, but he said he kept getting sniffles that ruined his sales presentations. After that, he sold ultra-sonic toothbrushes but claimed they gave him headaches, even though he didn’t really have a gold inlay tooth to blame for it.

Now, Ben had a new job with a big company called Amalgamated Production for Living, or ALPRODLIV. He was about to start his first big assignment, and even though he felt a bit of excitement, he was still uneasy.

""Mr. Robb will see you now, Mr. Tilman,"" came a robotic voice from the desk. The human receptionist had left for the day. The robot secretary, though not human-looking, was helpful and opened the door for Ben.

Inside, the Old Man, Mr. Robb, was sitting at his big desk. He was bald and a little chubby, but still a great sales manager. Ben greeted him, but Mr. Robb didn’t respond until Ben tapped the hearing aid on his chest. ""Oh, Ben. It’s you,"" Mr. Robb said, adjusting the hearing aid. Ben knew the Old Man used it to tune out conversations he didn’t want to hear.

Mr. Robb asked Ben if everything was ready for that night’s assignment. Ben explained his plan to keep their guests in suspense before revealing the big sales pitch. Mr. Robb was excited, thinking it was a fresh approach that could make a lot of money. He praised Ben, and for a moment, Ben felt good about the work ahead.

On his way home in his company soar-kart, Ben thought about how the Old Man was a great sales manager and how the house-warming pitch he and Betty planned might really work. It made him feel a bit better about things.

When he got home, Betty was waiting for him. They talked about their son Bennie, who had been drawing on the walls with a pencil instead of playing with his robot Playmate. Nana, the robot nanny, wanted Bennie punished, but Ben didn’t agree. He thought Bennie should be allowed to do some things on his own.

Later, Ben and Betty hosted three couples at their party. Throughout the evening, they dropped hints but never directly pitched what they were selling. The guests were curious and trying to guess what Ben and Betty were selling. Finally, Ben revealed it was the house and everything in it. The guests were impressed, and two of them signed contracts to buy similar homes.

After the party, Betty praised Ben for his skill in selling all three couples. She was happy, thinking about the vacation they could take. But Ben was still not entirely satisfied. He felt the same unease he had with his previous jobs.

At work the next day, the Old Man congratulated Ben on his success. He offered him a new challenge—selling books. People weren’t reading as much anymore, and the Old Man wanted Ben to change that. Ben was intrigued and mentioned a man he had met at a camp who was writing a book. The Old Man dismissed the idea but gave Ben a vacation pass.

Ben realized the Old Man was a robot and turned off his hearing aid, leaving the office with a smile. He felt like he had finally made a choice for himself.

Meanwhile, Betty, who was also a robot, decided she would support Ben’s decision. She wanted to help him be happy. She was glad they were going to the camp, where there would be things to do and they could be content.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Ben Tilman's internal struggle with dissatisfaction and unease despite having a seemingly perfect life. Ben has a good job, a loving family, and financial stability, yet he feels unfulfilled and restless. This dissatisfaction leads him to frequently change jobs, searching for something that can bring him genuine happiness and contentment.

Throughout the narrative, Ben grapples with the pressure to conform to societal expectations and succeed in his career, as epitomized by his interactions with Mr. Robb, the sales manager. Despite the success and praise he receives for his sales abilities, Ben remains discontented, indicating that the root of his unhappiness is not related to his professional achievements.

The story reaches a turning point when Ben realizes that Mr. Robb is a robot, which symbolizes the mechanical and impersonal nature of his work and life. This revelation prompts Ben to contemplate making choices that align with his own desires rather than those dictated by his job or societal norms.

Ultimately, the conflict is resolved when Ben decides to pursue a path that might lead to personal fulfillment, hinted at by his interest in selling books and the vacation to the camp.

005.txt,"""We should just clean this planet of every living thing,"" muttered Umbo Stetson, head of Investigation & Adjustment.

Stetson paced the control bridge of his scout ship. His footsteps echoed on the floor, but now the ship rested on its tail fins—all four hundred shiny meters of it. The bridge's open windows looked out over the jungle top of Gienah III, about 150 meters below. A butter-yellow sun was hanging above the horizon, about an hour from setting.

""Clean like an egg!"" he barked. He paused in his walk, glared out the side window, and spat into the burned circle that the ship's jets had made in the jungle.

The I-A section chief had dark hair and a tall, lanky build with a large head and big features. He stood with his usual slouch, a stance not helped by his sack-like, patched blue fatigues. Even though he was in charge of this operation, his fatigues had no insignia. There was a messy, straggling look about him.

Lewis Orne, a new I-A field man with a fresh diploma, stood at the opposite window, studying the jungle horizon. Now and then he glanced at the control console, the clock above it, and the big map of their position on the opposite wall. Being from a heavy planet, he felt uneasy on Gienah III, with its gravity of only seven-eighths Terran Standard. The surgical scars on his neck where the communication equipment had been inserted itched like crazy. He scratched at them.

""Hah!"" said Stetson. ""Politicians!""

A thin black insect with shell-like wings flew in Orne's window and landed in his short red hair. Orne gently removed it and let it go. It tried to land in his hair again. He ducked, and it flew out the window beside Stetson.

Orne had a strong, no-fat look, but something about his blocky, off-center features made him seem like a clown.

""I'm getting tired of waiting,"" he said.

""You're tired! Hah!""

A breeze rippled the tops of the green sea below them. Here and there, red and purple flowers stuck out, bending and nodding like an attentive audience.

""Just look at that blasted jungle!"" barked Stetson. ""Them and their stupid orders!""

A call bell tinkled on the control console. The red light above the speaker grid started blinking. Stetson shot an angry glance at it. ""Yeah, Hal?""

""O.K., Stet. Orders just came through. We use Plan C. Command says to brief the field man, and get out of here.""

""Did you ask them about using another field man?""

Orne looked up, paying attention.

The speaker said: ""Yes. They said we have to use Orne because of the records on the _Delphinus_.""

""Well then, will they give us more time to brief him?""

""Negative. It's crash priority. Command expects to blast the planet anyway.""

Stetson glared at the grid. ""Those fat-headed, lard-bottomed, pig-brained ... POLITICIANS!"" He took two deep breaths and calmed down. ""O.K. Tell them we'll comply.""

""One more thing, Stet.""

""What now?""

""I've got a confirmed contact.""

Instantly, Stetson was alert. ""Where?""

""About ten kilometers out. Section AAB-6.""

""How many?""

""A mob. You want I should count them?""

""No. What're they doing?""

""Making a beeline for us. You better get a move on.""

""O.K. Keep us posted.""

""Right.""

---

Stetson looked across at his junior field man. ""Orne, if you decide you want out of this assignment, just say the word. I'll back you up.""

""Why would I want out of my first field assignment?""

""Listen, and find out."" Stetson went to a locker behind the big map, pulled out a white coverall uniform with gold insignia, and tossed it to Orne. ""Get into these while I brief you on the map.""

""But this is an R&R uni—"" began Orne.

""Get that uniform on your frame!""

""Yes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir. Right away, sir. But I thought I was done with Rediscovery & Reeducation when you drafted me off of Hamal into the I-A ... sir."" He began changing from the I-A blue to the R&R white. Almost as an afterthought, he said: ""... Sir.""

A wolfish grin cracked Stetson's big features. ""I'm soooooo happy you have the proper attitude toward authority.""

Orne zipped up the coverall uniform. ""Oh, yes, sir ... sir.""

""O.K., Orne, pay attention."" Stetson pointed at the map with its green grid squares. ""Here we are. Here's that city we flew over on our way down. Head for it as soon as we drop you. The place is big enough that if you hold a course roughly northeast you can't miss it. We're—""

Again the call bell rang.

""What is it this time, Hal?"" barked Stetson.

""They've changed to Plan H, Stet. New orders cut.""

""Five days?""

""That's all they can give us. Command says he can't keep the information out of High Commissioner Bullone's hands any longer than that.""

""It's five days for sure then.""

""Is this the usual R&R foul-up?"" asked Orne.

Stetson nodded. ""Thanks to Bullone and company! We're just one step ahead of disaster, but they still pump the nonsense into the Rah & Rah boys back at dear old Uni-Galacta!""

""You're making light of my esteemed alma mater,"" said Orne. He struck a pose. ""We must reunite the lost planets with our centers of culture and industry, and take up the glorious onward march of mankind that was so brutally—""

""Can it!"" snapped Stetson. ""We both know we're going to rediscover one planet too many someday. Rim War all over again. But this is a different case. It's not, repeat, not a rediscovery.""

Orne sobered. ""Alien?""

""Yes. A-L-I-E-N! A never-before-contacted culture. That language you were force fed on the way over, that's an alien language. It's not complete ... all we have off the minis. And we excluded data on the natives because we've been hoping to dump this project and nobody the wiser.""

""Holy cow!""

""Twenty-six days ago an I-A search ship came through here, had a routine mini-sneaker look at the place. When he combed in his net of sneakers to check the tapes and films, lo and behold, he had a little stranger.""

""One of _theirs_?""

""No. It was a mini off the _Delphinus Rediscovery_. The _Delphinus_ has been unreported for eighteen standard months!""

""Did it crash here?""

""We don't know. If it did, we haven't been able to spot it. She was supposed to be way off in the Balandine System by now. But we've something else on our minds. It's the one thing that makes me want to wipe out this place, and run home with my tail between my legs. We've a—""

Again the call bell chimed.

""NOW WHAT?"" roared Stetson into the speaker.

""I've got a mini over that mob, Stet. They're talking about us. It's a definite raiding party.""

""What armament?""

""Too dark in that jungle to be sure. The infra beam's out on this mini. Looks like hard pellet rifles of some kind. Might even be off the _Delphinus_.""

""Can't you get closer?""

""Wouldn't do any good. No light down there, and they're moving up fast.""

""Keep an eye on them, but don't ignore the other sectors,"" said Stetson.

""You think I was born yesterday?"" barked the voice from the grid. The contact broke off with an angry sound.

---

""One thing I like about the I-A,"" said Stetson. ""It collects such even-tempered types."" He looked at the white uniform on Orne, wiped a hand across his mouth as though he’d tasted something dirty.

""Why _am_ I wearing this thing?"" asked Orne.

""Disguise.""

""But there's no mustache!""

Stetson smiled without humor. ""That's one of I-A's answers to those fat-keistered politicians. We're setting up our own search system to find the planets before _they_ do. We've managed to put spies in key places at R&R. Any touchy planets our spies report, we divert the files.""

""Then what?""

""Then we look into them with bright boys like you—disguised as R&R field men.""

""Goody, goody. And what happens if R&R stumbles onto me while I'm down there playing patty cake?""

""We disown you.""

""But you said an I-A ship found this joint.""

""It did. And then one of our spies in R&R intercepted a _routine_ request for an agent-instructor to be assigned here with full equipment. Request signed by a First-Contact officer name of Diston ... of the _Delphinus_!""

""But the Del—""

""Yeah. Missing. The request was a forgery. Now you see why I'm mostly for rubbing out this place. Who'd dare forge such a thing unless he knew for sure that the original FC officer was missing ... or dead?""

""What the heck are we doing here, Stet?"" asked Orne. ""Alien calls for a full contact team with all of the—""

""It calls for one planet-buster bomb ... buster—in five days. Unless you give them a white bill in the meantime. High Commissioner Bullone will have word of this planet by then. If Gienah III still exists in five days, can't you imagine the fun the politicians'll have with it? Mama mia! We want this planet cleared for contact or dead before then.""

""I don't like this, Stet.""

""YOU don't like it!""

""Look,"" said Orne. ""There must be another way. Why ... when we teamed up with the Alerinoids we gained five hundred years in the physical sciences alone, not to mention the—""

""The Alerinoids didn't knock over one of our survey ships first.""

""What if the _Delphinus_ just crashed here ... and the locals picked up the pieces?""

""That's what you're going in to find out, Orne. But answer me this: If they _do_ have the _Delphinus_, how long before a tool-using race could be a threat to the galaxy?""

""I saw that city they built, Stet. They could be dug in within six months, and there'd be no—""

""Yeah.""

Orne shook his head. ""But think of it: Two civilizations that matured along different lines! Think of all the different ways we'd approach the same problems ... the lever that'd give us for—""

""You sound like a Uni-Galacta lecture! Are you through marching arm in arm into the misty future?""

Orne took a deep breath. ""Why's a freshman like me being tossed into this dish?""

""You'd still be on the _Delphinus_ master lists as an R&R field man. That's important if you're masquerading.""

""Am I the only one? I know I'm a recent _convert_, but—""

""You want out?""

""I didn't say that. I just want to know why I'm—""

""Because the bigdomes fed a set of requirements into one of their iron monsters. Your card popped out. They were looking for somebody capable, dependable ... and ... _expendable_!""

""Hey!""

""That's why I'm down here briefing you instead of sitting back on a flagship. _I_ got you into the I-A. Now, you listen carefully: If you push the panic button on this one without cause, I will personally flay you alive. We both know the advantages of an alien contact. But if you get into a hot spot, and call for help, I'll dive this cruiser into that city to get you out!""

Orne swallowed. ""Thanks, Stet. I'm—""

---

""We're going to take up a tight orbit. Out beyond us will be five transports full of I-A marines and a Class IX Monitor with one planet-buster. You're calling the shots, God help you! First, we want to know if they have the _Delphinus_ ... and if so, where it is. Next, we want to know just how warlike these goons are. Can we control them if they're bloodthirsty. What's their potential?""

""In five days?""

""Not a second more.""

""What do we know about them?""

""Not much. They look something like an ancient Terran chimpanzee ... only with blue fur. Face is hairless, pink-skinned."" Stetson snapped a switch. The map became a screen with a figure frozen on it. ""Like that. This is life-size.""

""Looks like the missing link they're always hunting for,"" said Orne. ""Yeah, but you've got a different kind of a missing link.""

""Vertical-slit pupils in their eyes,"" said Orne. He studied the figure. It had been caught from the front by a mini-sneaker camera. About five feet tall. The stance was slightly bent forward, long arms. Two vertical nose slits. A flat, lipless mouth. Receding chin. Four-fingered hands. It wore a wide belt from which dangled neat pouches and what looked like tools, although their use was obscure. There appeared to be the tip of a tail protruding from behind one of the squat legs. Behind the creature towered the faery spires of the city they'd observed from the air.

""Tails?"" asked Orne.

""Yeah. They're arboreal. Not a road on the whole planet that we can find. But there are lots of vine lanes through the jungles."" Stetson's face hardened. ""Match _that_ with a city as advanced as that one.""

""Slave culture?""

""Probably.""

""How many cities have they?""

""We've found two. This one and another on the other side of the planet. But the other one's a ruin.""

""A ruin? Why?""

""You tell us. Lots of mysteries here.""

""What's the planet like?""

""Mostly jungle. There are polar oceans, lakes and rivers. One low mountain chain follows the equatorial belt about two-thirds around the planet.""

""But only two cities. Are you sure?""

""Reasonably so. It'd be pretty hard to miss something the size of that thing we flew over. It must be fifty kilometers long and at least ten wide. Swarming with these creatures, too. We've got a zone-count estimate that places the city's population at over thirty million.""

""Whee-ew! Those are tall buildings, too.""

""We don't know much about this place, Orne. And unless you bring them into the fold, there'll be nothing but ashes for our archaeologists to pick over.""

""Seems a dirty shame.""

""I agree, but—""

The call bell jangled.

---

Stetson's voice sounded tired: ""Yeah, Hal?""

""That mob's only about five kilometers out, Stet. We've got Orne's gear outside in the disguised air sled.""

""We'll be right down.""

""Why a disguised sled?"" asked Orne.

""If they think it's a ground buggy, they might get careless when you most need an advantage. We could always scoop you out of the air, you know.""

""What're my chances on this one, Stet?""

Stetson shrugged. ""I'm afraid they're slim. These goons probably have the _Delphinus_, and they want you just long enough to get your equipment and everything you know.""

""Rough as that, eh?""

""According to our best guess. If you're not out in five days, we blast.""

Orne cleared his throat.

""Want out?"" asked Stetson.

""No.""

""Use the _back-door_ rule, son. Always leave yourself a way out. Now ... let's check that equipment the surgeons put in your neck."" Stetson put a hand to his throat. His mouth remained closed, but there was a surf-hissing voice in Orne's ears: ""You read me?""

""Sure. I can—""

""No!"" hissed the voice. ""Touch the mike contact. Keep your mouth closed. Just use your speaking muscles without speaking.""

Orne obeyed.

""O.K.,"" said Stetson. ""You come in loud and clear.""

""I ought to. I'm right on top of you!""

""There'll be a relay ship over you all the time,"" said Stetson. ""Now ... when you're not touching that mike contact this rig'll still feed us what you say ... and everything that goes on around you, too. We'll monitor everything. Got that?""

""Yes.""

Stetson held out his right hand. ""Good luck. I meant that about diving in for you. Just say the word.""

""I know the word, too,"" said Orne. ""HELP!""

---

Gray mud floor and gloomy aisles between monstrous bluish tree trunks—that was the jungle. Only the barest weak glimmering of sunlight penetrated to the mud. The disguised sled—its para-grav units turned off—lurched and skidded around buttress roots. Its headlights swung in wild arcs across the trunks and down to the mud. Aerial creepers—great looping vines of them—swung down from the towering forest ceiling. A steady drip of condensation spattered the windshield, forcing Orne to use the wipers.

In the bucket seat of the sled's cab, Orne fought the controls. He was plagued by the vague slow-motion-floating sensation that a heavy planet native always feels in lighter gravity. It gave him an unhappy stomach.

Things skipped through the air around the lurching vehicle: flitting and darting things. Insects came in twin cones, siphoned toward the headlights. There was an endless chittering whistling tok-tok-toking in the gloom beyond the lights.

Stetson's voice hissed suddenly through the surgically implanted speaker: ""How's it look?""

""Alien.""

""Any sign of that mob?""

""Negative.""

""O.K. We're taking off.""

Behind Orne, there came a deep rumbling roar that receded as the scout cruiser climbed its jets. All other sounds hung suspended in after-silence, then resumed: the strongest first and then the weakest.

A heavy object suddenly arced through the headlights, swinging on a vine. It disappeared behind a tree. Another. Another. Ghostly shadows with vine pendulums on both sides. Something banged down heavily onto the hood of the sled.

---

Orne braked to a creaking stop that shifted the load behind him, found himself staring through the windshield at a native of Gienah III. The native crouched on the hood, a Mark XX exploding-pellet rifle in his right hand directed at Orne's head. In the abrupt shock of meeting, Orne recognized the weapon: standard issue to the marine guards on all R&R survey ships.

The native appeared the twin of the one Orne had seen on the translite screen. The four-fingered hand looked extremely capable around the stock of the Mark XX.

Slowly, Orne put a hand to his throat, pressed the contact button. He moved his speaking muscles: _""Just made contact with the mob. One on the hood now has one of our Mark XX rifles aimed at my head.""_

The surf-hissing of Stetson's voice came through the hidden speaker: _""Want us to come back?""_

_""Negative. Stand by. He looks cautious rather than hostile.""_

Orne held up his right hand, palm out. He had a second thought: held up his left hand, too. Universal symbol of peaceful intentions: empty hands. The gun muzzle lowered slightly. Orne called into his mind the language that had been hypnoforced into him. _Ocheero? No. That means 'The People.' Ah ..._ And he had the heavy fricative greeting sound.

""Ffroiragrazzi,"" he said.

The native shifted to the left, answered in pure, unaccented High Galactese: ""Who are you?""

Orne fought down a sudden panic. The lipless mouth had looked so odd forming the familiar words.

Stetson's voice hissed: _""Is that the native speaking Galactese?""_

Orne touched his throat. _""You heard him.""_

He dropped his hand, said: ""I am Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and Reeducation. I was sent here at the request of the First-Contact officer on the _Delphinus Rediscovery_.""

""Where is your ship?"" demanded the Gienahn.

""It put me down and left.""

""Why?""

""It was behind schedule for another appointment.""

---

Out of the corners of his eyes, Orne saw more shadows dropping to the mud around him. The sled shifted as someone climbed onto the load behind the cab. The someone scuttled agilely for a moment.

The native climbed down to the cab's side step, opened the door. The rifle was held at the ready. Again, the lipless mouth formed Galactese words: ""What do you carry in this ... vehicle?""

""The equipment every R&R field man uses to help the people of a rediscovered planet improve themselves."" Orne nodded at the rifle. ""Would you mind pointing that weapon some other direction? It makes me nervous.""

The gun muzzle remained unwaveringly on Orne's middle. The native's mouth opened, revealing long canines. ""Do we not look strange to you?""

""I take it there's been a heavy mutational variation in the humanoid norm on this planet,"" said Orne. ""What is it? Hard radiation?""

No answer.

""It doesn't really make any difference, of course,"" said Orne. ""I'm here to help you.""

""I am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,"" said the native. ""I decide who is to help.""

Orne swallowed.

""Where do you go?"" demanded Tanub.

""I was hoping to go to your city. Is it permitted?""

A long pause while the vertical-slit pupils of Tanub's eyes expanded and contracted. ""It is permitted.""

Stetson's voice came through the hidden speaker: _""All bets off. We're coming in after you. That Mark XX is the final straw. It means they have the_ Delphinus _for sure!""_

Orne touched his throat. _""No! Give me a little more time!""_

_""Why?""_

_""I have a hunch about these creatures.""_

_""What is it?""_

_""No time now. Trust me.""_

Another long pause in which Orne and Tanub continued to study each other. Presently, Stetson said: _""O.K. Go ahead as planned. But find out where the_ Delphinus _is! If we get that back we pull their teeth.""_

""Why do you keep touching your throat?"" demanded Tanub.

""I'm nervous,"" said Orne. ""Guns always make me nervous.""

The muzzle lowered slightly.

""Shall we continue on to your city?"" asked Orne. He wet his lips with his tongue. The cab light on Tanub's face was giving the Gienahn an eerie sinister look.

""We can go soon,"" said Tanub.

""Will you join me inside here?"" asked Orne. ""There's a passenger seat right behind me.""

Tanub's eyes moved catlike: right, left. ""Yes."" He turned, barked an order into the jungle gloom, then climbed in behind Orne.

""When do we go?"" asked Orne.

""The great sun will be down soon,"" said Tanub. ""We can continue as soon as Chiranachuruso rises.""

""Chiranachuruso?""

""Our satellite ... our moon,"" said Tanub.

""It's a beautiful word,"" said Orne. ""Chiranachuruso.""

""In our tongue it means: The Limb of Victory,"" said Tanub. ""By its light we will continue.""

Orne turned, looked back at Tanub. ""Do you mean to tell me that you can see by what light gets down here through those trees?""

""Can you not see?"" asked Tanub.

""Not without the headlights.""

""Our eyes differ,"" said Tanub. He bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical slit pupils of his eyes expanded, contracted. ""You are the same as the ... others.""

""Oh, on the _Delphinus_?""

Pause. ""Yes.""

Presently, a greater gloom came over the jungle, bringing a sudden stillness to the wild life. There was a chittering commotion from the natives in the trees around the sled. Tanub shifted behind Orne.

""We may go now,"" he said. ""Slowly ... to stay behind my ... scouts.""

""Right."" Orne eased the sled forward around an obstructing root.

---

Silence while they crawled ahead. Around them shapes flung themselves from vine to vine.

""I admired your city from the air,"" said Orne. ""It is very beautiful.""

""Yes,"" said Tanub. ""Why did you land so far from it?""

""We didn't want to come down where we might destroy anything.""

""There is nothing to destroy in the jungle,"" said Tanub.

""Why do you have such a big city?"" asked Orne.

Silence.

""I said: Why do you—""

""You are ignorant of our ways,"" said Tanub. ""Therefore, I forgive you. The city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight. Once—long ago—we used crude platforms on the tops of the trees. Now ... only the ... wild ones do this.""

Stetson's voice hissed in Orne's ears: _""Easy on the sex line, boy. That's always touchy. These creatures are oviparous. Sex glands are apparently hidden in that long fur behind where their chins ought to be.""_

""Who controls the breeding sites controls our world,"" said Tanub. ""Once there was another city. We destroyed it.""

""Are there many ... wild ones?"" asked Orne.

""Fewer each year,"" said Tanub.

_""There's how they get their slaves,""_ hissed Stetson.

""You speak excellent Galactese,"" said Orne.

""The High Path Chief commanded the best teacher,"" said Tanub. ""Do you, too, know many things, Orne?""

""That's why I was sent here,"" said Orne.

""Are there many planets to teach?"" asked Tanub.

""Very many,"" said Orne. ""Your city—I saw very tall buildings. Of what do you build them?""

""In your tongue—glass,"" said Tanub. ""The engineers of the _Delphinus_ said it was impossible. As you saw—they are wrong.""

_""A glass-blowing culture,""_ hissed Stetson. _""That'd explain a lot of things.""_

Slowly, the disguised sled crept through the jungle. Once, a scout swooped down into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped on Tanub's order, and they waited almost ten minutes before proceeding.

""Wild ones?"" asked Orne.

""Perhaps,"" said Tanub.

A glowing of many lights grew visible through the giant tree trunks. It grew brighter as the sled crept through the last of the jungle, emerged in cleared land at the edge of the city.

Orne stared upward in awe. The city fluted and spiraled into the moonlit sky. It was a fragile appearing lacery of bridges, winking dots of light. The bridges wove back and forth from building to building until the entire visible network appeared one gigantic dew-glittering web.

""All that with glass,"" murmured Orne.

_""What's happening?""_ hissed Stetson.

Orne touched his throat contact. _""We're just into the city clearing, proceeding toward the nearest building.""_

""This is far enough,"" said Tanub.

---

Orne stopped the sled. In the moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns all around. The buttressed pedestal of one of the buildings loomed directly ahead. It looked taller than had the scout cruiser in its jungle landing circle.

Tanub leaned close to Orne's shoulder. ""We have not deceived you, have we, Orne?""

""Huh? What do you mean?""

""You have recognized that we are not mutated members of your race.""

Orne swallowed. Into his ears came Stetson's voice: _""Better admit it.""_

""That's true,"" said Orne.

""I like you, Orne,"" said Tanub. ""You shall be one of my slaves. You will teach me many things.""

""How did you capture the _Delphinus_?"" asked Orne.

""You know that, too?""

""You have one of their rifles,"" said Orne.

""Your race is no match for us, Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in the prowess of the mind. Your ship landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior ceramics in those tubes.""

Orne turned, looked at Tanub in the dim glow of the cab light. ""Have you heard about the I-A, Tanub?""

""I-A? What is that?"" There was a wary tenseness in the Gienahn's figure. His mouth opened to reveal the long canines.

""You took the _Delphinus_ by treachery?"" asked Orne.

""They were simple fools,"" said Tanub. ""We are smaller, thus they thought us weaker."" The Mark XX's muzzle came around to center on Orne's stomach. ""You have not answered my question. What is the I-A?""

""I am of the I-A,"" said Orne. ""Where've you hidden the _Delphinus_?""

""In the place that suits us best,"" said Tanub. ""In all our history there has never been a better place.""

""What do you plan to do with it?"" asked Orne.

""Within a year we will have a copy with our own improvements. After that—""

""You intend to start a war?"" asked Orne.

""In the jungle the strong slay the weak until only the strong remain,"" said Tanub.

""And then the strong prey upon each other?"" asked Orne.

""That is a quibble for women,"" said Tanub.

""It's too bad you feel that way,"" said Orne. ""When two cultures meet like this they tend to help each other. What have you done with the crew of the _Delphinus_?""

""They are slaves,"" said Tanub. ""Those who still live. Some resisted. Others objected to teaching us what we want to know."" He waved the gun muzzle. ""You will not be that foolish, will you, Orne?""

""No need to be,"" said Orne. ""I've another little lesson to teach you: I already know where you've hidden the _Delphinus_.""

_""Go, boy!""_ hissed Stetson. _""Where is it?""_

""Impossible!"" barked Tanub.

""It's on your moon,"" said Orne. ""Darkside. It's on a mountain on the darkside of your moon.""

Tanub's eyes dilated, contracted. ""You read minds?""

""The I-A has no need to read minds,"" said Orne. ""We rely on superior mental prowess.""

_""The marines are on their way,""_ hissed Stetson. _""We're coming in to get you. I'm going to want to know how you guessed that one.""_

""You are a weak fool like the others,"" gritted Tanub.

""It's too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low grades of the R&R,"" said Orne.

_""Easy, boy,""_ hissed Stetson. _""Don't pick a fight with him now. Remember, his race is arboreal. He's probably as strong as an ape.""_

""I could kill you where you sit!"" grated Tanub.

""You write finish for your entire planet if you do,"" said Orne. ""I'm not alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There's a ship overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with molten rock. It'd run like the glass you use for your buildings.""

""You are lying!""

""We'll make you an offer,"" said Orne. ""We don't really want to exterminate you. We'll give you limited membership in the Galactic Federation until you prove you're no menace to us.""

_""Keep talking,""_ hissed Stetson. _""Keep him interested.""_

""You dare insult me!"" growled Tanub.

""You had better believe me,"" said Orne. ""We—""

Stetson's voice interrupted him: _""Got it, Orne! They caught the_ Delphinus _on the ground right where you said it'd be! Blew the tubes off it. Marines now mopping up.""_

""It's like this,"" said Orne. ""We already have recaptured the _Delphinus_."" Tanub's eyes went instinctively skyward. ""Except for the captured armament you still hold, you obviously don't have the weapons to meet us,"" continued Orne. ""Otherwise, you wouldn't be carrying that rifle off the _Delphinus_.""

""If you speak the truth, then we shall die bravely,"" said Tanub.

""No need for you to die,"" said Orne.

""Better to die than be slaves,"" said Tanub.

""We don't need slaves,"" said Orne. ""We—""

""I cannot take the chance that you are lying,"" said Tanub. ""I must kill you now.""

---

Orne's foot rested on the air sled control pedal. He depressed it. Instantly, the sled shot skyward, heavy G's pressing them down into the seats. The gun in Tanub's hands was slammed into his lap. He struggled to raise it. To Orne, the weight was still only about twice that of his home planet of Chargon. He reached over, took the rifle, found safety belts, bound Tanub with them. Then he eased off the acceleration.

""We don't need slaves,"" said Orne. ""We have machines to do our work. We'll send experts in here, teach you people how to exploit your planet, how to build good transportation facilities, show you how to mine your minerals, how to—""

""And what do we do in return?"" whispered Tanub.

""You could start by teaching us how you make superior glass,"" said Orne. ""I certainly hope you see things our way. We really don't want to have to come down there and clean you out. It'd be a shame to have to blast that city into little pieces.""

Tanub wilted. Presently, he said: ""Send me back. I will discuss this with ... our council."" He stared at Orne. ""You I-A's are too strong. We did not know.""

---

In the wardroom of Stetson's scout cruiser, the lights were low, the leather chairs comfortable, the green beige table set with a decanter of Hochar brandy and two glasses.

Orne lifted his glass, sipped the liquor, smacked his lips. ""For a while there, I thought I'd never be tasting anything like this again.""

Stetson took his own glass. ""Command heard the whole thing over the general monitor net,"" he said. ""D'you know you've been breveted to senior field man?""

""Ah, they've already recognized my sterling worth,"" said Orne.

The wolfish grin took over Stetson's big features. ""Senior field men last about half as long as the juniors,"" he said. ""Mortality's terrific?""

""I might've known,"" said Orne. He took another sip of the brandy.

Stetson flicked on the switch of a recorder beside him. ""O.K. You can go ahead any time.""

""Where do you want me to start?""

""First, how'd you spot right away where they'd hidden the _Delphinus_?""

""Easy. Tanub's word for his people was _Grazzi_. Most races call themselves something meaning _The People_. But in his tongue that's _Ocheero_. _Grazzi_ wasn't on the translated list. I started working on it. The most likely answer was that it had been adopted from another language, and meant _enemy_.""

""And _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?""

""No. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I'd kind of felt from the first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the Indians of ancient Terra.""

""Why?""

""They came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right onto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you see?""

""I guess so.""

""Then he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn't on the language list, either. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There's a word in almost every language in history that means raider and derives from a word for road, path or highway.""

""Highwaymen,"" said Stetson.

""Raid itself,"" said Orne. ""An ancient Terran language corruption of road.""

""Yeah, yeah. But where'd all this translation griff put—""

""Don't be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon was _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it just fell into place.""

""How?""

""The vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn't that mean anything to you?""

""Maybe. What's it mean to you?""

""Night-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from above. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And Tanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in all of their history. History? That'd be a high place. Dark, likewise. Ergo: a high place on the darkside of their moon.""

""I'm a pie-eyed greepus,"" whispered Stetson.

Orne grinned, said: ""You probably are ... sir.""

THE END",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the potential threat posed by the alien inhabitants of Gienah III to the Galactic Federation, represented by the Investigation & Adjustment (I-A) team. The I-A, led by Stetson, is concerned that the inhabitants of Gienah III, who have captured the missing ship Delphinus, might become a significant threat to the galaxy if they possess advanced technology. This prompts a dilemma: whether to obliterate the planet to neutralize the potential threat or to attempt peaceful contact and assimilation into the Galactic Federation.

Lewis Orne, a junior field man, is sent to assess the situation and determine if the inhabitants are hostile and if they indeed have control of the Delphinus, all while under a tight deadline, as the High Commissioner will soon learn of the planet. Orne's mission is complicated by the need to ensure the planet's inhabitants are not a threat while also considering the potential benefits of peaceful contact with an alien civilization.

I

Halvorsen was waiting in the office while Monsignor Reedy finished with three other people who were there before him. Halvorsen felt dizzy because he was hungry and didn't notice right away that the secretary was signaling him. He stood up when the secretary pointedly opened the door to Monsignor Reedy's inner office and gestured for him to come in.

Halvorsen walked across the floor, forgetting that he had left his portfolio by his chair. He remembered at the door, turned back to get it, and blushed. The secretary looked patient.

""Thanks,"" Halvorsen murmured as the door closed behind him.

Something seemed off about the way Monsignor Reedy was acting.

""I brought the designs for the Stations, Father,"" Halvorsen said, opening the portfolio on the desk.

""Bad news, Roald,"" said Monsignor Reedy. ""I know you've been looking forward to the commission—""

""Did someone else get it?"" Halvorsen asked faintly, leaning against the desk. ""I thought his eminence had definitely decided I had the—""

""It's not that,"" the Monsignor said. ""But the Sacred Congregation of Rites announced this week that stereopantograph images can be used in a diocese if the bishop allows it. And his eminence—""

""S.P.G.—those fake imitations,"" Halvorsen protested. ""They're as real as a plastic eye. No texture. No soul. You know that, Father!"" he said accusingly.

""I'm sorry, Roald,"" the Monsignor said. ""Your work is better than what we'll get from a stereopantograph—at least to my eyes. But there are other things to consider.""

""Money!"" the artist spat.

""Yes, money,"" the Monsignor admitted. ""His eminence wants to finish the St. Xavier U. building program before he dies. Is that a mortal sin? And there are our schools, our charities, our Venus mission. S.P.G. will save us a lot on buying and maintaining devotional images. Even if I could, I wouldn't disagree with his eminence's decision to adopt it as diocesan policy.""

The Monsignor's eyes lingered on the detailed drawings of the Stations of the Cross.

""Your St. Veronica,"" he said abstractedly. ""Very fine. It reminds me of one of Caravaggio's care-worn saints. I would have liked to see her in the bronze.""

""So would I,"" Halvorsen said hoarsely. ""Keep the drawings, Father."" He started for the door.

""But I can't—""

""That's all right.""

The artist walked past the secretary blindly and out into the spring sunlight of Fifth Avenue. He hoped Monsignor Reedy was enjoying the drawings and felt ashamed of himself and sorry for Halvorsen. And he was glad he didn't have to carry the heavy portfolio anymore. Everything seemed so heavy lately—chisels, hammer, wooden palette. Maybe the Monsignor would send him something and pretend it was for expenses or an advance, like he had in the past.

Halvorsen's feet carried him up the Avenue. No, there wouldn't be any more advances. The last steady trickle of income had just dried up, thanks to an announcement in Osservatore Romano. Religious conservatism had taken the church as far as it could in its ancient role as a patron of the arts.

When all of Europe was writing on the wonderful new vellum, the church stuck to good old papyrus. When all of Europe was writing on the wonderful new paper, the church stuck to good old vellum. When all architects and municipal monument committees and portrait bust clients were using the stereopantograph, the church stuck to good old expensive sculpture. But not anymore.

He was passing an S.P.G. salon now, where one of his Tuesday night students worked: one of the few men in the classes. Mostly they were lazy, moody, irritable girls. Halvorsen, surprised at himself, entered the salon, walking between thin, almost-nude stereos made of transparent plastic that made his neck and shoulders prickle with goosebumps.

""Slime!"" he thought. ""How can they—""

""May I help—oh, hello, Roald. What brings you here?""

He suddenly knew why he had come there. ""Could you give me a little advance on next month's tuition, Lewis? I'm strapped."" He took a nervous look around the room, avoiding the man's condescending face.

""I guess so, Roald. Would ten dollars help? That'll get us through to the 25th, right?""

""Fine, right, sure,"" he said, while being unwillingly led around the place.

""I know you don't think much of S.P.G., but it's quiet now, so this is a good chance to see how we work. I don't say it's Art with a capital A, but you have to admit it's an art, something people like at a price they can afford. Here's where we sit them. Then you run out the feelers to the reference points on the face. You know what they are?""

He heard himself say dryly, ""I know what they are. The Egyptian sculptors used them when they carved statues of the pharaohs.""

""Yes? I never knew that. There's nothing new under the sun, is there? But this is the heart of the S.P.G."" The young man proudly opened the door of an electronic device in the wall of the portrait booth. Tubes winked sullenly at Halvorsen.

""The esthetikon?"" he asked indifferently. He didn't feel indifferent, but it would be absurd to show anger, no matter how much he felt it, against a mindless collection of circuits that could calculate layouts, criticize and correct pictures for a desired effect—and that had put the artist of design out of a job.

""Yes. The lenses take sixteen profiles, you know, and we set the esthetikon for whatever we want—cute, rugged, sexy, spiritual, brainy, or a combination. It fairs curves from profile to profile to give us just what we want, distorts the profiles themselves within limits if it has to, and there's your portrait stored in the memory tank waiting to be taped. You set your ratio for any enlargement or reduction you want and play it back. I wish we were reproducing today; it's fascinating to watch. You just pour in your cold-set plastic, the nozzles ooze out a core and start crawling over to scan—a drop here, a worm there, and it begins to take shape.

""We mostly do portrait busts here, the Avenue trade, but Wilgus, the foreman, used to work in a monument shop in Brooklyn. He did that heroic-size war memorial on the East River Drive—hired Garda Bouchette, the TV girl, for the central figure. And what a figure! He told me he set the esthetikon plates for three-quarters sexy, one-quarter spiritual. Here's something interesting—standing figurine of Orin Ryerson, the banker. He ordered twelve. Figurines are coming in. The girls like them because they can show their shapes. You'd be surprised at some of the poses they want to try—""

Somehow, Halvorsen got out with the ten dollars, walked to Sixth Avenue, and sat down hard in a cheap restaurant. He had coffee and dozed a little, waking with a guilty start at a racket across the street. There was a building going up. For a while, he watched the great machines pour walls and floors, the workmen rolling here and there on their little chariots to weld on a wall panel, stripe on an electric circuit of conductive ink, or spray plastic finish over the ""wired"" wall, all without leaving the saddles of their little mechanical chariots.

Halvorsen felt more determined. He bought a paper from a vending machine by the restaurant door, drew another cup of coffee, and turned to the help-wanted ads.

The tricky trade-school ads urged him to learn construction work and make big money. Be a plumbing-machine setup man. Be a house-wiring machine tender. Be a servotruck driver. Be a lumber-stacker operator. Learn pouring-machine maintenance.

Make big money!

A sort of panic overcame him. He ran to the phone booth and dialed a Passaic number. He heard the ring-ring-ring and strained to hear old Mr. Krehbeil's stumping footsteps growing louder as he neared the phone, even though he knew he would hear nothing until the receiver was picked up.

Ring—ring—ring. ""Hello?"" grunted the old man's voice, and his face appeared on the little screen. ""Hello, Mr. Halvorsen. What can I do for you?""

Halvorsen was tongue-tied. He couldn't possibly say: I just wanted to see if you were still there. I was afraid you weren't there anymore. He choked and improvised: ""Hello, Mr. Krehbeil. It's about the banister on the stairs in my place. I noticed it's pretty shaky. Could you come over sometime and fix it for me?""

Krehbeil peered suspiciously out of the screen. ""I could do that,"" he said slowly. ""I don't have much work nowadays. But you can carpenter as well as me, Mr. Halvorsen, and frankly, you're very slow pay, and I like cabinet work better. I'm not a young man, and climbing around on ladders takes it out of me. If you can't find anybody else, I'll take the work, but I got to have some of the money first, just for the materials. It isn't easy to get good wood anymore.""

""All right,"" said Halvorsen. ""Thanks, Mr. Krehbeil. I'll call you if I can't get anybody else.""

He hung up and went back to his table and newspaper. His face was burning with anger at the old man's reluctance and his own foolish panic. Krehbeil didn't realize they were both in the same leaky boat. Krehbeil, who didn't get a job in a month, still thought with senile pride that he was a journeyman carpenter and cabinetmaker who could make his solid way anywhere with his toolbox and his skill, and that he could afford to look down on anything as disreputable as an artist—even an artist who could carpenter as well as he did himself.

Labuerre had made Halvorsen learn carpentry, and Labuerre had been right. You build a scaffold so you can sculpt up high, not so it will collapse and you break a leg. You build your platforms so they hold the rock steady, not so it wobbles and chatters at every blow of the chisel. You build your armatures so they hold the plasticine you slam onto them.

But the help-wanted ads wanted no builders of scaffolds, platforms, and armatures. The factories were calling for setup men and maintenance men for the production and assembly machines.

From upstate, General Vegetables had sent a recruiting team for farm help—harvest setup and maintenance men, a few openings for experienced operators of tank-caulking machinery. Under ""office and professional,"" the demand was heavy for computer men, for girls who could run the I.B.M. Letteriter, especially familiar sales and collections correspondence, for office machinery maintenance and repairmen. A job printing house wanted an esthetikon operator for letterhead layouts and the like. A.T. & T. wanted trainees to earn while learning telephone maintenance. A direct-mail advertising outfit wanted an artist—no, they wanted a sales-executive who could scrawl picture-ideas that would be subjected to the criticism and correction of the esthetikon.

Halvorsen leafed tiredly through the rest of the paper. He knew he wouldn't get a job, and if he did, he wouldn't hold it. He knew it was a terrible thing to admit to yourself that you might starve to death because you were bored by anything except art, but he admitted it.

It had happened often enough in the past—artists undergoing preposterous hardships, not, as people thought, because they were devoted to art, but because nothing else was interesting. If there were only some impressive, sonorous word that summed up the aching, oppressive futility that overcame him when he tried to get out of art—only there wasn't.

He thought he could tell which of the photos in the tabloid had been corrected by the esthetikon.

There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, who was to star in a remake of Peter Pan. Her ears had been made to look not pointed but pointy, her upper lip had been lengthened a trifle, her nose had been pugged a little and tilted quite a lot, her freckles were cuter than cute, her brows were innocently arched, and her lower lip and eyes were nothing less than pornography.

There was a shot, apparently uncorrected, of the last Venus ship coming in at La Guardia, and the average-looking explorers grinning. Caption: ""Austin Malone and crew smile relief on safe arrival. Malone says Venus colonies need men, machines. See story p. 2.""

Petulantly, Halvorsen threw the paper under the table and walked out. What had space travel to do with him? Vacations on the Moon and expeditions to Venus and Mars were part of the deadly encroachment on his livelihood and no more.

II

He took the subway to Passaic and walked down a long-still traffic beltway to his studio, almost the only building alive in the slums near the rusting railroad freight yard.

A sign that had once said ""F. Labuerre, Sculptor—Portraits and Architectural Commissions"" now said ""Roald Halvorsen; Art Classes—Reasonable Fees."" It was a grimy two-story frame building with a shopfront in which were mounted some of his students' charcoal figure studies and oil still lifes. He lived upstairs, taught downstairs front, and did his own work downstairs, back behind dirty, ceiling-high drapes.

Going in, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock the door again. He slammed it bitterly. At the noise, somebody called from behind the drapes: ""Who's that?""

""Halvorsen!"" he yelled in a sudden fury. ""I live here. I own this place. Come out of there! What do you want?""

There was fumbling at the drapes, and a girl stepped between them, shrinking from their dirt.

""Your door was open,"" she said firmly, ""and it's a shop. I've just been here a couple of minutes. I came to ask about classes, but I don't think I'm interested if you're this bad-tempered.""

A pupil. Pupils were never to be abused, especially not now.

""I'm terribly sorry,"" he said. ""I had a trying day in the city."" Now turn it on. ""I wouldn't tell everybody a terrible secret like this, but I've lost a commission. You understand? I thought so. Anybody who'd traipse out here to my dingy abode would be simpatica. Won't you sit down? No, not there—humor an artist and sit over there. The warm background of that still-life brings out your color—quite good color. Have you ever been painted? You've a very interesting face, you know. Some day I'd like to—but you mentioned classes.

""We have figure classes, male and female models alternating, on Tuesday nights. For that, I have to be very stern and ask you to sign up for an entire course of twelve lessons at sixty dollars. It's the models' fees—they're exorbitant. Saturday afternoons we have still-life classes for beginners in oils. That's only two dollars a class, but you might sign up for a series of six and pay ten dollars in advance, which saves you two whole dollars. I also give private instructions to a few talented amateurs.""

The price was open on that one—whatever the traffic would bear. It had been a year since he'd had a private pupil, and she'd taken only six lessons at five dollars an hour.

""The still-life sounds interesting,"" said the girl, holding her head self-consciously the way they all did when he gave them the patter. It was a good head, carried well up. The muscles clung close, not yet slacked into geotropic loops and lumps. The line of youth is heliotropic, he confusedly thought. ""I saw some interesting things back there. Was that your own work?""

She rose, obviously with the expectation of being taken into the studio. Her body was one of those long-lined, small-breasted, coltish jobs that the pre-Raphaelites loved to draw.

""Well—"" said Halvorsen. A deliberate show of reluctance and then a bright smile of confidence. ""You'll understand,"" he said positively, and drew aside the curtains.

""What a curious place!"" She wandered about, inspecting the drums of plaster, clay, and plasticine, the racks of tools, the stands, the stones, the chisels, the forge, the kiln, the lumber, the glaze bench.

""I like this,"" she said determinedly, picking up a figure a half-meter tall, a Venus he had cast in bronze while studying under Labuerre some years ago. ""How much is it?""

An honest answer would scare her off, and there was no chance in the world that she'd buy. ""I hardly ever put my things up for sale,"" he told her lightly. ""That was just a little study. I do work on commission only nowadays.""

Her eyes flicked about the dingy room, seeming to take in its scaling plaster and warped floor and see through the wall to the abandoned slum in which it was set. There was amusement in her glance.

I am not being honest, she thinks. She thinks that is funny. Very well, I will be honest. ""Six hundred dollars,"" he said flatly.

The girl set the figurine on its stand with a rap and said, half angry and half amused, ""I don't understand it. That's more than a month's pay for me. I could get an S.P.G. statuette just as pretty as this for ten dollars. Who do you artists think you are, anyway?""

Halvorsen debated with himself about what he could say in reply:

An S.P.G. operator spends a week learning his skill, and I spend a lifetime learning mine.

An S.P.G. operator makes a mechanical copy of a human form distorted by formulas mechanically arrived at from psychotests of population samples. I take full responsibility for my work; it is mine, though I use what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Augustan and Romantic and Modern Eras.

An S.P.G. operator works in soft, homogeneous plastic; I work in bronze that is more complicated than you dream, that is cast and acid-dipped today so it will slowly take on rich and subtle coloring many years from today.

An S.P.G. operator could not make an Orpheus Fountain—

He mumbled, ""Orpheus,"" and keeled over.

Halvorsen awoke in his bed on the second floor of the building. His fingers and toes buzzed electrically, and he felt very clear-headed. The girl and a man, unmistakably a doctor, were watching him.

""You don't seem to belong to any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,"" the doctor said irritably. ""There weren't any cards on you at all. No Red, no Blue, no Green, no Brown.""

""I used to be on the Green Plan, but I let it lapse,"" the artist said defensively.

""And look what happened!""

""Stop nagging him!"" the girl said. ""I'll pay you your fee.""

""It's supposed to come through a Plan,"" the doctor fretted.

""We won't tell anybody,"" the girl promised. ""Here's five dollars. Just stop nagging him.""

""Malnutrition,"" said the doctor. ""Normally I'd send him to a hospital, but I don't see how I could manage it. He isn't on any Plan at all. Look, I'll take the money and leave some vitamins. That's what he needs—vitamins. And food.""

""I'll see that he eats,"" the girl said, and the doctor left.

""How long since you've had anything?"" she asked Halvorsen.

""I had some coffee today,"" he answered, thinking back. ""I'd been working on detail drawings for a commission, and it fell through. I told you that. It was a shock.""

""I'm Lucretia Grumman,"" she said, and went out.

He dozed until she came back with an armful of groceries.

""It's hard to get around down here,"" she complained.

""It was Labuerre's studio,"" he told her defiantly. ""He left it to me when he died. Things weren't so rundown in his time. I studied under him; he was one of the last. He had a joke—'They don't really want my stuff, but they're ashamed to let me starve.' He warned me that they wouldn't be ashamed to let me starve, but I insisted, and he took me in.""

Halvorsen drank some milk and ate some bread. He thought of the change from the ten dollars in his pocket and decided not to mention it. Then he remembered that the doctor had gone through his pockets.

""I can pay you for this,"" he said. ""It's very kind of you, but you mustn't think I'm penniless. I've just been too preoccupied to take care of myself.""

""Sure,"" said the girl. ""But we can call this an advance. I want to sign up for some classes.""

""I'd be happy to have you.""

""Am I bothering you?"" asked the girl. ""You said something odd when you fainted—'Orpheus.'""

""Did I say that? I must have been thinking of Milles' Orpheus Fountain in Copenhagen. I've seen photos, but I've never been there.""

""Germany? But there's nothing left of Germany.""

""Copenhagen's in Denmark. There's quite a lot of Denmark left. It was only on the fringes. Heavily radiated, but still there.""

""I want to travel, too,"" she said. ""I work at La Guardia, and I've never been off, except for an orbiting excursion. I want to go to the Moon on my vacation. They give us a bonus in travel vouchers. It must be wonderful dancing under the low gravity.""

Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? Terms belonging to the detested electronic world of the stereopantograph in which he had no place.

""Be very interesting,"" he said, closing his eyes to conceal disgust.

""I am bothering you. I'll go away now, but I'll be back Tuesday night for the class. What time do I come, and what should I bring?""

""Eight. It's charcoal—I sell you the sticks and paper. Just bring a smock.""

""All right. And I want to take the oils class, too. And I want to bring some people I know to see your work. I'm sure they'll see something they like. Austin Malone's in from Venus—he's a special friend of mine.""

""Lucretia,"" he said. ""Or do some people call you Lucy?""

""Lucy.""

""Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?""

""I can't do that!""

""Please. I'd feel much better about this. I really mean it.""

She nodded abruptly, flushing, and almost ran from the room.

Now why did I do that? he asked himself. He hoped it was because he liked Lucy Grumman very much. He hoped it wasn't a cold-blooded investment of a piece of sculpture that would never be sold, anyway, just to make sure she'd be back with class fees and more groceries.

III

She was back on Tuesday, a half-hour early and carrying a smock. He introduced her formally to the others as they arrived: a dozen or so bored young women who, he suspected, talked a great deal about their art lessons outside, but in class used any excuse to stop sketching.

He didn't dare show Lucy any particular consideration. There were fierce little miniature cliques in the class. Halvorsen knew they laughed at him and his line among themselves, and yet, strangely, were fiercely jealous of their seniority and right to individual attention.

The lesson was an ordeal, as usual. The model, a muscle-bound young graduate of the barbell gyms and figure-photography studios, was stupid and argumentative about ten-minute poses. Two of the girls came near a hair-pulling brawl over the rights to a preferred sketching location. A third girl had discovered Picasso's cubist period during the past week and proudly announced that she didn't feel perspective in art.

But the two interminable hours finally ticked by. He nagged them into cleaning up—not as bad as the Saturdays with oils—and stood by the open door. Otherwise, they would have stayed all night, cackling about absent students and snarling sulkily among themselves. His well-laid plans went sour, though. A large and flashy car drove up as the girls were leaving.

""That's Austin Malone,"" said Lucy. ""He came to pick me up and look at your work.""

That was all the wedge her fellow-pupils needed.

""Austin Ma-lone! Well!""

""Lucy, darling, I'd love to meet a real spaceman.""

""Roald, darling, would you mind very much if I stayed a moment?""

""I'm certainly not going to miss this, and I don't care if you mind or not, Roald, darling!""

Malone was an impressive figure. Halvorsen thought: he looks as though he's been run through an esthetikon set for 'brawny' and 'determined.' Lucy made a hash of the introductions, and the spaceman didn't rise to conversational bait dangled enticingly by the girls.

In a clear voice, he said to Halvorsen: ""I don't want to take up too much of your time. Lucy tells me you have some things for sale. Is there any place we can look at them where it's quiet?""

The students made sulky exits.

""Back here,"" said the artist.

The girl and Malone followed him through the curtains. The spaceman made a slow circuit of the studio, seeming to repel questions.

He sat down at last and said: ""I don't know what to think, Halvorsen. This place stuns me. Do you know you're in the Dark Ages?""

People who never have given a thought to Chartres and Mont St. Michel usually call it the Dark Ages, Halvorsen thought wryly. He asked, ""Technologically, you mean? No, not at all. My plaster's better, my colors are better, my metal is better—tool metal, not casting metal, that is.""

""I mean hand work,"" said the spaceman. ""Actually working by hand.""

The artist shrugged. ""There have been crazes for the techniques of the boiler works and the machine shop,"" he admitted. ""Some interesting things were done, but they didn't stand up well. Is there anything here that catches your eye?""

""I like those dolphins,"" said the spaceman, pointing to a perforated terra-cotta relief on the wall. They had been commissioned by an architect, then later refused for reasons of economy when the house had run way over estimate. ""They'd look great over the fireplace in my town apartment. Like them, Lucy?""

""I think they're wonderful,"" said the girl.

Roald saw the spaceman go rigid with the effort not to turn and stare at her. He loved her, and he was jealous.

Roald told the story of the dolphins and said: ""The price that the architect thought was too high was three hundred and sixty dollars.""

Malone grunted. ""Doesn't seem unreasonable—if you set a high store on inspiration.""

""I don't know about inspiration,"" the artist said evenly. ""But I was awake for two days and two nights shoveling coal and adjusting drafts to fire that thing in my kiln.""

The spaceman looked contemptuous. ""I'll take it,"" he said. ""Be something to talk about during those awkward pauses. Tell me, Halvorsen, how's Lucy's work? Do you think she ought to stick with it?""

""Austin,"" objected the girl, ""don't be so blunt. How can he possibly know after one day?""

""She can't draw yet,"" the artist said cautiously. ""It's all coordination, you know—thousands of hours of practice, training your eye and hand to work together until you can put a line on paper where you want it. Lucy, if you're really interested in it, you'll learn to draw well. I don't think any of the other students will. They're in it because of boredom or snobbery, and they'll stop before they have their eye-hand coordination.""

""I am interested,"" she said firmly.

Malone's determined restraint broke. ""Damned right you are. In—"" He recovered himself and demanded of Halvorsen: ""I understand your point about coordination. But thousands of hours when you can buy a camera? It's absurd.""

""I was talking about drawing, not art,"" replied Halvorsen. ""Drawing is putting a line on paper where you want it, I said."" He took a deep breath and hoped the great distinction wouldn't sound ludicrous and trivial. ""So let's say that art is knowing how to put the line in the right place.""

""Be practical. There isn't any art. Not anymore. I get around quite a bit, and I never see anything but photos and S.P.G.s. A few heirlooms, yes, but nobody's painting or carving anymore.""

""There's some art, Malone. My students—a couple of them in the still-life class—are quite good. There are more across the country. Art for occupational therapy, or a hobby, or something to do with the hands. There's trade in their work. They sell them to each other, they give them to their friends, they hang them on their walls. There are even some sculptors like that. Sculpture is prescribed by doctors. The occupational therapists say it's even better than drawing and painting, so some of these people work in plasticine and soft stone, and some of them get to be good.""

""Maybe so. I'm an engineer, Halvorsen. We glory in doing things the easy way. Doing things the easy way got me to Mars and Venus, and it's going to get me to Ganymede. You're doing things the hard way, and your inefficiency has no place in this world. Look at you! You've lost a fingertip—some accident, I suppose.""

""I never noticed—"" said Lucy, and then let out a faint, ""Oh!""

Halvorsen curled the middle finger of his left hand into the palm, where he usually carried it to hide the missing first joint.

""Yes,"" he said softly. ""An accident.""

""Accidents are a sign of inadequate mastery of material and equipment,"" said Malone sententiously. ""While you stick to your methods and I stick to mine, you can't compete with me.""

His tone made it clear that he was talking about more than engineering.

""Shall we go now, Lucy? Here's my card, Halvorsen. Send those dolphins along, and I'll mail you a check.""

IV

The artist walked the half-dozen blocks to Mr. Krehbeil's place the next day. He found the old man in the basement shop of his fussy house, hunched over his bench with a powerful light overhead. He was trying to file a saw.

""Mr. Krehbeil!"" Halvorsen called over the shriek of metal.

The carpenter turned around and peered with watery eyes. ""I can't see like I used to,"" he said querulously. ""I go over the same teeth on this damn saw, I skip teeth, I can't see the light shine off it when I got one set. The glare."" He banged down his three-cornered file petulantly. ""Well, what can I do for you?""

""I need some crating stock. Anything. I'll trade you a couple of my maple four-by-fours.""

The old face became cunning. ""And will you set my saw? My saws, I mean. It's nothing to you—an hour's work. You have the eyes.""

Halvorsen said bitterly, ""All right."" The old man had to drive his bargain, even though he might never use his saws again. And then the artist promptly repented of his bitterness, offering up a quick prayer that his own failure to conform didn't make him as much of a nuisance to the world as Krehbeil was.

The carpenter was pleased as they went through his small stock of wood and chose boards to crate the dolphin relief. He was pleased enough to give Halvorsen coffee and cake before the artist buckled down to filing the saws.

Over the kitchen table, Halvorsen tried to probe. ""Things pretty slow now?""

It would be hard to spoil Krehbeil's day now. ""People are always fools. They don't know good hand work. Some day,"" he said apocalyptically, ""I laugh on the other side of my face when their foolish machine-buildings go falling down in a strong wind, all of them, all over the country. Even my boy—I used to beat him good, almost every day—he works a foolish concrete machine, and his house should fall on his head like the rest.""

Halvorsen knew it was Krehbeil's son who supported him by mail and changed the subject. ""You get some cabinet work?""

""Stupid women! What they call antiques—they don't know Meissen, they don't know Biedermeier. They bring me trash to repair sometimes. I make them pay; I swindle them good.""

""I wonder if things would be different if there were anything left over in Europe...""

""People will still be fools, Mr. Halvorsen,"" said the carpenter positively. ""Didn't you say you were going to file those saws today?""

So the artist spent two noisy hours filing before he carried his crating stock to the studio.

Lucy was there. She had brought some things to eat. He dumped the lumber with a bang and demanded, ""Why aren't you at work?""

""We get days off,"" she said vaguely. ""Austin thought he'd give me the cash for the terra-cotta, and I could give it to you.""

She held out an envelope while he studied her silently. The farce was beginning again. But this time he dreaded it.

It would not be the first time that a lonesome, discontented girl chose to see him as a combination of romantic rebel and lost pup, with the consequences you'd expect.

He knew from books, experience, and Labuerre's conversations in the old days that there was nothing novel about the comedy—that there had even been artists, lots of them, who had counted on endless repetitions of it for their livelihood.

The girl drops in with groceries, and the artist is pleasantly surprised; the girl admires this little thing or that after payday and buys it, and the artist is pleasantly surprised; the girl brings her friends to take lessons or make little purchases, and the artist is pleasantly surprised. The girl may be seduced by the artist or vice versa, which shortens the comedy, or they get married, which lengthens it somewhat.

It had been three years since Halvorsen had last played out the farce with a manic-depressive divorcee from Elmira: three years during which he had crossed the midpoint between thirty and forty; three more years to get beaten down by being unwanted and working too much and eating too little.

Also, he knew, he was in love with this girl.

He took the envelope, counted three hundred and twenty dollars, and crammed it into his pocket. ""That was your idea,"" he said. ""Thanks. Now get out, will you? I've got work to do.""

She stood there, shocked.

""I said get out. I have work to do.""

""Austin was right,"" she told him miserably. ""You don't care how people feel. You just want to get things out of them.""

She ran from the studio, and Halvorsen fought with himself not to run after her.

He walked slowly into his workshop and studied his array of tools, though he paid little attention to his finished pieces. It would be nice to spend about half of this money on open-hearth steel rod and bar stock to forge into chisels; he thought he knew where he could get some—but she would be back, or he would break and go to her, and be forgiven, and the comedy would be played out, after all.

He couldn't let that happen.

Aalesund, on the Atlantic side of the Dourefeld mountains of Norway, was in the lee of the blasted continent. One more archeologist there made no difference, as long as he had the sense to recognize the propeller-like international signposts that said with their three blades, Radiation Hazard, and knew what every schoolboy knew about protective clothing and reading a personal Geiger counter.

The car Halvorsen rented was for a brief trip over the mountains to study contaminated Oslo. Well-muffled, he could make it and back in a dozen hours and no harm done.

But he took the car past Oslo, Wennersborg, and Goteborg, along the Kattegat coast to Helsingborg, and abandoned it there, among the three-bladed polyglot signs, crossing to Denmark. Danes were as unlike Prussians as they could be, but their unfortunate little peninsula was a sprout off Prussia, which radio-cobalt dust couldn't tell from the real thing. The three-bladed signs were most specific.

With a long way to walk along the rubble-littered highways, he stripped off the impregnated coveralls and boots. He had long since shed the noisy counter and the uncomfortable gloves and mask.

The silence was eerie as he limped into Copenhagen at noon. He didn't know whether the radiation was getting to him or whether he was tired and hungry and no more. As though thinking of a stranger, he liked what he was doing.

I'll be my own audience, he thought. God knows I learned there isn't any other, not any more. You have to know when to stop. Rodin, the dirty old, wonderful old man, knew that. He taught us not to slick it and polish it and smooth it until it looked like liquid instead of bronze and stone. Van Gogh was crazy as a loon, but he knew when to stop and varnish it, and he didn't care if the paint looked like paint instead of looking like sunset clouds or moonbeams. Up in Hartford, Browne and Sharpe stop when they've got a turret lathe; they don't put caryatids on it. I'll stop while my life is a life, before it becomes a thing with distracting embellishments such as a wife who will come to despise me, a succession of gradually less worthwhile pieces that nobody will look at.

Blame nobody, he told himself, lightheadedly.

And then it was in front of him, terminating a vista of weeds and bomb rubble—Milles' Orpheus Fountain.

It took a man, he thought. Esthetikon circuits couldn't do it. There was a gross mixture of styles, a calculated flaw that the esthetikon couldn't be set to make. Orpheus and the souls were classic or later; the three-headed dog was archaic. That was to tell you about the antiquity and invincibility of Hell, and that Cerberus knows Orpheus will never go back into life with his bride.

There was the heroic, tragic central figure that looked mighty enough to battle with the gods, but battle wasn't any good against the grinning, knowing, hateful three-headed dog it stood on. You don't battle the pavement where you walk or the floor of the house you're in; you can't. So Orpheus, his face a mask of controlled and suffering fury crashes a great chord from his lyre that moved trees and stones. Around him, the naked souls in Hell start at the chord, each in its own way: the young lovers down in death; the mother down in death; the musician, deaf and down in death, straining to hear.

Halvorsen, walking uncertainly toward the fountain, felt something break inside him, and a heaviness in his lungs. As he pitched forward among the weeds, he thought he heard the chord from the lyre and didn't care that the three-headed dog was grinning its knowing, hateful grin down at him.

VI

When Halvorsen awoke, he supposed he was in Hell. There were the young lovers, arms about each other's waists, solemnly looking down at him, and the mother was placidly smoothing his brow. He stirred and felt his left arm fall heavily.

""Ah,"" said the mother, ""you mustn't."" He felt her pick up his limp arm and lay it across his chest. ""Your poor finger!"" she sighed. ""Can you talk? What happened to it?""

He could talk, weakly. ""Labuerre and I,"" he said. ""We were moving a big block of marble with the crane—somehow the finger got under it. I didn't notice until it was too late to shift my grip without the marble slipping and smashing on the floor.""

The boy said in a solemn, adolescent croak, ""You mean you saved the marble and lost your finger?""

""Marble,"" he muttered. ""It's so hard to get. Labuerre was so old.""

The young lovers exchanged a glance, and he slept again. He was half-awake when the musician seized first one of his hands and then the other, jabbing them with stubby fingers and bending his lion's head close to peer at the horny callouses left by chisel and mallet.

""Ja, ja,"" the musician kept saying.

Hell goes on forever, so for an eternity, he jolted and jarred, and for an eternity he heard bickering voices: ""Why was he so foolish, then?"" ""An idiot he could be."" ""Hush, let him rest."" ""The children told the story."" ""There only one Labuerre was."" ""Easy with the tubing."" ""Let him rest.""

Daylight dazzled his eyes.

""Why were you so foolish?"" demanded a harsh voice. ""The sister says I can talk to you now, so that is what I first want to know.""

He looked at the face of—not the musician; that had been delirium. But it was a tough old face.

""Ja, I am mean-looking; that is settled. What did you think you were doing without coveralls and way over your exposure time?""

""I wanted to die,"" said Halvorsen. There were tubes sticking in his arms.

The crag-faced old man let out a contemptuous bellow.

""Sister!"" he shouted. ""Pull the plasma tubes out before more we waste. He says he wants to die.""

""Hush,"" said the nurse. She laid her hand on his brow again.

""Don't bother with him, Sister,"" the old man jeered. ""He is a shrinking little flower, too delicate for the great, rough world. He has done nothing, he can do nothing, so he decides to make of himself a nuisance by dying.""

""You lie,"" said Halvorsen. ""I worked. Good God, how I worked! Nobody wanted my work. They wanted me, to wear in their buttonholes like a flower. They were getting to me. Another year, and I wouldn't have been an artist anymore.""

""Ja?"" asked the old man. ""Tell me about it.""

Halvorsen told him, sometimes weeping with self-pity and weakness, sometimes cursing the old man for not letting him die, sometimes quietly describing this statuette or that portrait head, or raving wildly against the mad folly of the world.

At the last, he told the old man about Lucy.

""You cannot have everything, you know,"" said his listener.

""I can have her,"" answered the artist harshly. ""You wouldn't let me die, so I won't die. I'll go back, and I'll take her away from that fat-head Malone that she ought to marry. I'll give her a couple of happy years working herself to skin and bones for me before she begins to hate it—before I begin to hate it.""

""You can't go back,"" said the old man. ""I'm Cerberus. You understand that? The girl is nothing. The society you come from is nothing. We have a place here... Sister, can he sit up?""

The woman smiled and cranked his bed. Halvorsen saw through a picture window that he was in a mountain-rimmed valley that was very green and dotted with herds and unpainted houses.

""Such a place there had to be,"" said the old man. ""In the whole geography of Europe, there had to be a Soltau Valley with winds and terrain just right to deflect the dust.""

""Nobody knows?"" whispered the artist.

""We prefer it that way. It's impossible to get some things, but you would be surprised how little difference it makes to the young people. They are great travelers, the young people, in their sweaty coveralls with radiation meters. They think when they see the ruined cities that the people who lived in them must have been mad. It was a little travel party like that which found you. The boy was impressed by something you said, and I saw some interesting things in your hands. There isn't much rock around here; we have fine, deep topsoil. But the boys could get you stone.

""There should be a statue of the Mayor, for one thing, before I die. And from the Rathaus, the wooden angels have mostly broken off. Soltau Valley used to be proud of them—could you make good copies? And of course, cameras are useless, and the best drawings we can do look funny. Could you teach the youngers at least to draw so faces look like faces and not behinds? And like you were saying about you and Labuerre, maybe one younger there will be so crazy that he will want to learn it all, so Soltau will always have an artist and sculptor for the necessary work. And you will find a Lucy or somebody better. I think better.""

""Hush,"" warned the nurse. ""You're exciting the patient.""

""It's all right,"" said Halvorsen eagerly. ""Thanks, but it's really all right.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the struggle between traditional artistic craftsmanship and the encroaching dominance of technology in the realm of art. Roald Halvorsen, the protagonist, is a dedicated sculptor who finds his livelihood threatened by the advent of the stereopantograph (S.P.G.), a technological device that creates art more cheaply and efficiently than human hands can. This conflict highlights the broader theme of technological advancement versus human skill and the personal and societal value of art.

Halvorsen's personal dilemma is his fight to remain true to his art in a world that increasingly values speed, cost-efficiency, and technological reproduction over the soul and texture that handcrafted art provides. This struggle is not just professional but deeply personal, as it affects his sense of identity, purpose, and survival.

The story also explores Halvorsen's internal conflict between his dedication to his craft and the practical need to survive in a changing world. He is torn between maintaining his artistic integrity and succumbing to the economic pressures that demand he adapt to new technologies. This dilemma is compounded by his interactions with other characters, such as Monsignor Reedy, who represents the economic and institutional pressures to adopt technology, and Lucretia Grumman, who brings a personal dimension to his life and represents a potential escape from his isolation.

Ultimately, Halvorsen's journey takes him to a place where he can continue his art without the overwhelming pressure of technology, suggesting a resolution to his conflict by finding a community that values his skills and offers him a chance to contribute meaningfully. This resolution underscores the story's exploration of the value of human creativity and craftsmanship in a world increasingly dominated by technology.",Is your art worth dying for when technology makes it obsolete?,What if your identity crumbles when society chooses tech over talent?,How long would you fight for art in a world that doesn't care anymore?,science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,Who is Halvorsen?,Halvorsen is an artist struggling to find work in a society where technology has made traditional art obsolete.,Why does Halvorsen feel upset about the stereopantograph?,"Halvorsen feels upset because the stereopantograph creates art that lacks the texture and soul of traditional art, and it has taken away his opportunities for commissions.",What might Halvorsen do to adapt to the changes in his society?,"Halvorsen might consider learning new skills related to technology or finding a niche where traditional art is still valued, such as teaching or creating unique pieces that can't be replicated by machines.",How does the story illustrate the conflict between tradition and technology?,The story illustrates this conflict through Halvorsen's struggle to find work as an artist in a world where technology like the stereopantograph has made traditional art less valuable.

007.txt,"I don't say I can tell a story the way it should be told. I just say I know how a story should be told because I've spent years with some of the best storytellers.

There are different types of stories, but the hardest one is the humorous story. I'll mainly talk about that. The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, and the witty story is French. The humorous story relies on how it's told; the comic and witty stories rely on what's in them.

The humorous story can be long and wander around without reaching a specific point, but the comic and witty stories need to be short and have a punchline. The humorous story bubbles along gently; the others burst.

The humorous story is really a work of art—high and delicate art—and only an artist can tell it. But no art is needed to tell comic and witty stories; anyone can do it. The art of telling a humorous story—by word of mouth, not print—was created in America and has stayed here.

The humorous story is told seriously; the teller tries to hide that there's anything funny about it. But the teller of the comic story tells you it's one of the funniest things they’ve ever heard, then tells it excitedly and is the first to laugh when done. Sometimes, if successful, they'll repeat the funny part to get applause. It's a bit sad to watch.

Often, the rambling humorous story ends with a punchline or ""nub,"" but it's dropped casually to seem unimportant. Artemus Ward used this trick a lot; so did Dan Setchell, and Nye and Riley use it today.

The teller of the comic story doesn’t hide the punchline; they shout it. And when printed in England, France, Germany, or Italy, they italicize it, add exclamation points, and sometimes explain it in parentheses, which is depressing and makes one want to quit joking.

Let me show you an example of the comic method with an anecdote popular for over a thousand years. It’s told like this:

THE WOUNDED SOLDIER

During a battle, a soldier who lost a leg asked another soldier to carry him to safety, saying he’d lost his leg. The helpful soldier carried him through flying bullets and cannonballs until one cannonball took off the wounded man’s head without the carrier noticing. Soon, an officer asked, “Where are you going with that body?”

“To the rear, sir—he's lost his leg!” 

“His leg?” said the officer, “You mean his head!”

The soldier put down the body and looked at it confused. Then he said, “It’s true, just like you said. But he TOLD me IT WAS HIS LEG—”

Here, the storyteller bursts into loud laughter, repeating the punchline with each laugh.

It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic form, and it’s not worth telling after all. But in the humorous form, it takes ten minutes and is about the funniest thing when James Whitcomb Riley tells it.

He tells it as a slow-witted old farmer who thinks it’s hilariously funny and tries to repeat it to a neighbor but gets all mixed up, wandering with unnecessary details and mistakes, and finally remembers the soldier's name wasn’t mentioned, saying it’s not important. This goes on, while the audience laughs until they’re exhausted.

The farmer’s simplicity, innocence, and sincerity are perfectly acted, and the performance is charming. This is art and beautiful, and only a master can do it; but a machine could tell the other story.

To string absurdities together and seem unaware of them is the base of American art, if I’m correct. Another feature is slurring the point, dropping a remark as if thinking aloud, and pausing.

Artemus Ward used the pause. He'd start telling something exciting, then lose confidence and pause, adding an incongruous remark to explode the joke—and it worked.

For example, he’d say excitedly, “I once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn’t a tooth in his head”—then pause and dreamily add, “and yet that man could beat a drum better than any man I ever saw.”

The pause is key in any story and must be just the right length—no more, no less.

I used to tell a ghost story with a pause before the end, and if I got it right, I could spring the ending to make someone yelp and jump—what I was after. The story was “The Golden Arm,” and told like this:

THE GOLDEN ARM

Once upon a time, there was a mean man who lived out on the prairie with his wife. She died, and he buried her out there. She had a golden arm, and he wanted it badly. At midnight, he got his lantern, dug her up, and took the arm. As he plowed through the snow, he stopped (pause) and said, “What’s that!”

He listened, and the wind said, “Bzzz-z-zzz”—and from the grave, he heard a voice, “Bzzz-zzz—Who got my golden arm?”

He shivered and said, “Oh, my! Oh, my!” and the wind blew out the lantern. He plowed home, scared, as the voice came closer, “Who got my golden arm?”

At the house, he rushed upstairs, covered up, and shivered. Then he heard it again! Then it was at the door! Then by the bed! (Pause.) Then he felt something cold near his head! (Pause.)

Then the voice said, “Who got my golden arm?” (Say this plaintively; then stare at a girl in the audience, pause, and yell, “You’ve got it!”)

If you got the pause right, she'll yelp and jump. But the pause is tricky.

MENTAL TELEGRAPHY AGAIN

I have some curious incidents to share that seem like “Mental Telegraphy,” a concept I wrote about years ago.

Several years ago, I toured with Mr. George W. Cable. In Montreal, we had a reception. I recognized a familiar face among strangers and thought, “That’s Mrs. R.; I forgot she was Canadian.” She had been a friend in Nevada, but I hadn’t seen her in twenty years. I saw her clearly and noted her dress. I was eager for her to come, but she didn’t.

That evening, someone said, “A friend is here to see you.” I thought, “It’s Mrs. R.” I recognized her in the room, dressed as I saw her earlier. But she said she wasn’t at the reception; she just arrived from Quebec. I was surprised. How could I have seen her? Was it thought-transference?

Another incident might be called “coincidence.” I thought of lecturing in the antipodes after years, and wrote to Henry M. Stanley about it. His reply mentioned Mr. R. S. Smythe, the lecture agent for Australia and New Zealand. I wrote Smythe about a tour on February 3rd. Three days later, I got a letter from Smythe, dated December 17th, offering terms similar to Stanley’s. His letter answered my inquiry before I sent it. Was this mental telegraphy?

Next, in March, I was in America with Mr. John Brisben Walker from the Cosmopolitan magazine. At the Century Club, I thought about honorary membership at the Lotos Club. I had been a member for over twenty years but rarely visited. I decided to request honorary membership to avoid dues. Later in Hartford, Mr. F. G. Whitmore told me the Lotos Club had made me a life member without dues. Had the board’s decision reached me through the air?

Another incident involved a visit to Miss Porter's school in Farmington with Rev. Joseph H. Twichell. I told an anecdote of meeting a lieutenant in Italy. Afterward, a young lady from the school remembered meeting me in Milan through the same lieutenant. Was this coincidence or thought-transference?

THE INVALID'S STORY

I seem sixty and married, but that’s due to my bad health. I’m actually forty-one and a bachelor. I lost my health two years ago on a train trip with a box of guns, which I mistook for a friend’s remains.

I’m from Cleveland, Ohio. One winter night, I heard my best friend, John B. Hackett, had died. His last wish was for me to take him home to his parents in Wisconsin. I rushed to the station, found a white-pine box with his name, and got it on the express car. I got some food, and when I returned, I saw a young man nailing a card on a similar box. I was puzzled, but the train was leaving, so I jumped in the express car.

A stranger set a package of cheese on the box. I hadn’t heard of Limburger cheese then. The expressman, Thompson, was cheerful and closed the car up. Soon, a terrible smell filled the car. I thought it was my friend and was sad. Thompson went on humming, but the smell grew stronger. He started a fire, which worried me about my friend’s condition.

Thompson eventually noticed the smell and asked if the box was a friend of mine. I said yes. He commented on the smell. We talked about how everyone has to go sometime, and he asked what my friend died of and how long he’d been dead. I said two or three days, but Thompson seemed to think it was much longer.

The smell got worse, and we tried cigars, but it didn’t help. Thompson suggested moving the box, but he slipped and fell on the cheese. We took turns breathing at a broken window. At another station, Thompson brought a bag of things to burn, hoping to mask the smell, but it only made it worse. We had to stay outside on the platform.

We were taken off the train, frozen and unconscious, at the next station. I had a fever for weeks. I found out later I’d spent the night with guns and cheese, but it was too late. Imagination had ruined my health, and I’m on my way home to die.

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of How Tell a Story and Others by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in Mark Twain's ""How to Tell a Story and Others"" revolves around the contrast between different styles of storytelling and the challenges associated with mastering the art of delivering humorous stories. Twain distinguishes between humorous, comic, and witty stories, emphasizing the unique nuances and skills required to effectively tell a humorous story, which he considers an American art form.

Through various anecdotes and examples, Twain illustrates the difficulty in achieving the right tone, timing, and delivery needed to make a humorous story successful. The tension lies in the storyteller's ability to maintain a serious demeanor while subtly delivering humor, as opposed to the more straightforward comic and witty styles that rely on obvious punchlines.

Additionally, in the story ""The Invalid's Story,"" there is a conflict between perception and reality, as the protagonist's imagination leads to his deteriorating health after mistaking a box of guns and cheese for his deceased friend's remains. This story highlights the power of the mind and perception, further underscoring Twain's exploration of storytelling and the impact of narrative on human experience.",What if you had to convince the world that the way you tell a story is more important than the story itself?,You're in a storytelling duel—do you go for the flashy punchline or the artful pause that makes the audience beg for more?,"You're in a room of storytellers from around the world; can you master the art of American humor, where the joke hides in plain sight?",comedy,comedy,good vs. evil,What are the three types of stories mentioned in the text?,"The text mentions three types of stories: the humorous story, the comic story, and the witty story.",Why is the humorous story considered a work of art?,"The humorous story is considered a work of art because it relies on the way it is told, requiring skill and artistry to deliver it effectively, unlike comic and witty stories that depend on their content.",How might you tell a humorous story differently from a comic story?,"To tell a humorous story, you would focus on the delivery, using a serious tone and possibly wandering through the narrative without rushing to the punchline. For a comic story, you would focus on the punchline and deliver it with excitement and emphasis.",What role does the 'pause' play in telling a humorous story?,"The 'pause' in a humorous story is crucial for timing. It allows the storyteller to build suspense or mislead the audience, making the eventual punchline or twist more impactful. The right length of pause can enhance the comedic effect.",Do you think the humorous story is more effective than the comic story? Why or why not?,"The effectiveness of a humorous story versus a comic story depends on the audience and context. A humorous story can be more engaging and memorable due to its artistry and delivery, while a comic story might be more immediately gratifying with its straightforward punchline.",Imagine you are telling a humorous story.

008.txt,"This is how it all started—the terrible civil strife that devastates our world!

The old lady with the big shopping bag was right in the middle of the crosswalk when she saw a big black car speeding towards her.

Behind the thick, bullet-proof glass, the seven people inside looked blurry, like they were in a diving bell.

She realized she didn't have enough time to get to either side of the street before the car reached her. It was going to catch her in the gutter.

It was no use trying to fake out the car and run back, like a daring kid might do several times a day. She was too slow.

The car's loudspeaker let out some polite, empty laughter over the roaring engine.

From her fellow pedestrians waiting on the sidewalks, there came a gasp of horror.

The little old lady reached into her shopping bag and pulled out a big blue-black automatic gun. She held it with both hands, trying to control the kickback like a rodeo cowboy riding a bucking bronco.

Aiming at the base of the windshield, just like a hunter would aim for the spine of a charging buffalo, she fired three shots before the car hit her.

From the right-hand curb, a young woman in a wheelchair screamed a curse at the people in the car.

Smythe-de Winter, the driver, was not happy. The little old lady's last shot had taken out two people in his car pool. It went through the neck of Phipps-McHeath and buried itself in the skull of Horvendile-Harker.

Braking hard, Smythe-de Winter drove the car over the right-hand curb. Pedestrians scattered into doorways and narrow alleys, including a young man hopping high on crutches.

But Smythe-de Winter hit the girl in the wheelchair.

Then he drove quickly out of the Slum Ring into the Suburbs, a piece of rattan swinging from his car as a trophy. Despite losing two people, he felt angry and sad. The safe, predictable world around him seemed to be falling apart.

While his companions quietly mourned for Horvy and Phipps and cleaned up their blood, he frowned and shook his head.

“They shouldn’t let old ladies carry guns,” he muttered.

Witherspoon-Hobbs nodded in agreement from across the front-seat corpse. “They shouldn't let them carry anything. God, how I hate pedestrians,” he said, looking at his shrunken legs. “Cars forever!” he quietly cheered.

The incident had immediate effects throughout the city. At the combined wake for the little old lady and the girl in the wheelchair, a passionate speaker raged against the people from the suburbs, talking about the legendary old Los Angeles, where pedestrians were protected, even outside crosswalks. He called for a march across the nearest fancy lawns and golf courses of the motorists.

At the Sunnyside Crematorium, where the bodies of Phipps and Horvy were taken, another passionate speaker reminded everyone of the old Chicago justice, where pedestrians were not allowed to carry guns and anyone stepping off the sidewalk was fair game. He hinted that a big fire, started if needed with some gasoline, was the only solution for the Slums.

Skinny young people came out at dusk from the Slum Ring into the inner areas of the Suburbs, slashing tires, shooting expensive watchdogs, and writing dirty words on the clean cars of housewives that never went more than six blocks from home.

At the same time, groups of young suburban motorcyclists and scooter riders roared through the outer parts of the Slum Ring, scaring children off sidewalks, throwing stink bombs through second-story apartment windows, and spraying black paint on the fronts of shabby homes.

Some incidents—a thrown brick, a cut corner, big tacks in the Auto Club’s doorway—were even reported from the center of the city, which was usually neutral territory.

The Government acted quickly, stopping all traffic between the Center and the Suburbs and starting a 24-hour curfew in the Slum Ring. Government agents only moved by special vehicles to show they favored neither side.

The day of forced stillness for both pedestrians and motorists was spent in secret, angry preparations. Behind locked garage doors, machine guns that fired through the front of cars were set up, illegal blades were welded to hubcaps, and the edges of fenders were sharpened.

While nervous National Guardsmen patrolled the empty sidewalks of the Slum Ring, serious men and women wearing black armbands moved through secret tunnels and hidden doors, handing out weapons and paving stones, piling cobblestones on rooftops, and making traps for cars. Children got ready to soap intersections after dark. The Committee of Pedestrian Safety got its two precious anti-tank guns ready.

At nightfall, under the urging of the Government, representatives of the Pedestrians and the Motorists met on a big safety island at the boundary of the Slum Ring and the Suburbs.

Their assistants began a noisy argument about whether Smythe-de Winter had failed to honk before charging, whether the old lady had shot before the car was close enough, how many wheels of Smythe-de’s car had been on the sidewalk when he hit the girl in the wheelchair, and so on. After a while, the High Pedestrian and the Chief Motorist exchanged cautious winks and stepped aside.

The red glow of a hundred flares and the yellow light of a thousand lamps on yellow sawhorses around the safety island lit up two tired, worried faces.

“A word before we start,” the Chief Motorist whispered. “What’s the current Sanity Quotient of your adults?”

“Forty-one and dropping,” the High Pedestrian replied, looking around nervously. “I can hardly find helpers who are halfway sane.”

“Our own Sanity Quotient is thirty-seven,” the Chief Motorist revealed. He shrugged helplessly. “The wheels inside my people's heads are slowing down. I don't think they will be sped up in my lifetime.”

“They say the Government's only fifty-two,” the other said with a matching shrug.

“Well, I guess we must work out one more compromise,” the Chief Motorist suggested hollowly, “though sometimes I think we’re all just a madman’s dream.”

Two hours of intense talks produced the new Wheel-Foot Agreement. Among other things, pedestrian handguns were limited to slightly lower power and to .38 caliber and under, while motorists had to honk three times at a block’s distance before charging a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Two wheels over the curb turned a traffic kill from third-degree manslaughter to minor homicide. Blind pedestrians were allowed to carry grenades.

The Government quickly got to work. The new Wheel-Foot Agreement was announced over loudspeakers and posted everywhere. Teams of police and social workers moved through the Slum Ring, taking away oversized weapons and giving calming injections to the unruly. Teams of therapists and mechanics went from home to home in the Suburbs and from garage to garage, promoting peace and removing illegal weapons from cars. On advice from a rogue psychiatrist, who said it would help reduce aggression, a bullfighting show was announced, but it had to be canceled when the Decency League, which had a large mixed membership of both sides, protested strongly.

At dawn, the curfew was lifted in the Slum Ring and traffic resumed between the Suburbs and the Center. After a few uneasy moments, it was clear that the situation had returned to normal.

Smythe-de Winter drove his shiny black car along the Ring. A thick steel bolt with large washers on either side filled the hole the old lady’s bullet had made in the windshield.

A brick bounced off the roof. Bullets hit the side windows.

Smythe-de ran a handkerchief around his neck under his collar and smiled.

A block ahead, children were running into the street, yelling and making faces. Behind them limped a fat dog with a spiked collar.

Smythe-de suddenly sped up his engine. He didn’t hit any of the children, but he got the dog.

A flashing light on the dashboard showed him the right front tire was losing air. Must have hit the collar too! He pushed the emergency-air button and the flashing stopped.

He turned to Witherspoon-Hobbs and said with thoughtful satisfaction, “I like a normal, orderly world, where you always have a little success, but not too exciting; a little failure, but just enough to keep you alert.”

Witherspoon-Hobbs was looking at the next crosswalk. Its center had a brownish stain with tire tracks.

“That’s where you got the old lady, Smythe-de,” he remarked. “I’ll say this for her now: she had spirit.”

“Yes, that’s where I got her,” Smythe-de agreed flatly. He remembered the witchlike face getting bigger, her jerking shoulders in black clothes, the wild white-circled eyes. He suddenly found himself thinking that this was a very dull day.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the escalating tension and violence between pedestrians and motorists in a dystopian society. This conflict is sparked by a fatal incident involving an old lady with a gun and a speeding car driven by Smythe-de Winter, which results in multiple deaths, including the old lady and a young woman in a wheelchair. The incident serves as a catalyst for civil unrest, leading to violent retaliations between the residents of the Slum Ring and the Suburbs.

This conflict is fueled by deep-seated animosity and a breakdown of societal norms, resulting in a world where pedestrians and motorists are in constant opposition. The government's attempts to mediate and restore order through compromises, such as the Wheel-Foot Agreement, highlight the underlying dilemma of maintaining a semblance of peace in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.

The story explores themes of societal division, the erosion of sanity, and the struggle for power and control, as both sides prepare for further conflict despite attempts at resolution.

009.txt,"Amos Parry was a regional manager at Whelan, Inc., a company that dealt with farm and ranch chemicals and feeds. One morning, he arrived at work early and waited in the lab for Frank Barnes, the division's chief chemist. When Frank arrived, Amos noticed he seemed more nervous than usual. After some small talk, Amos got to the point. ""Frank, Sales is pushing for that new hormone.""

Frank immediately looked uneasy. ""Bill Detrick was on the phone about it yesterday, Mr. Parry. I’m sorry I was short with him.""

Amos smiled. ""If you were, he hasn’t mentioned it to me yet. But we should probably speed things up. We might get a call from Buffalo soon. How many people are working on it?""

""Well, two are helping with routine stuff, but I’ve done most of it myself, in the evenings and weekends. I didn’t want anyone to know too much about it. Mr. Parry, I’m worried.""

""Worried? What do you mean?""

""Let me show you the litter we’ve been testing it on.""

The pigs were in pens outside the lab. Amos had seen reports on their weight gain and health, but he hadn’t seen the animals for a couple of weeks. He looked at the first group. ""How old is that boar pig?""

""Not quite four months.""

Amos wasn’t an expert, but he had spent a lot of time on farms and thought the pig looked more mature. The other pigs in the pen were also unusual, looking more like wild hogs. ""Is it just the general health factor?"" he asked.

""I don’t think so, Mr. Parry. Remember I told you this wasn’t actually a hormone?""

""I know. You wanted to call it that for secrecy.""

""Yes, but I didn’t tell you what it really was. Mr. Parry, are you familiar with hypnotics? Especially mescaline?""

""No, I’m not, Frank.""

""Well, it’s a drug that causes strong hallucinations. This is a chemical derivative of it.""

Amos grinned. ""Pipe dreams for hogs?""

But then he stopped smiling. If the project failed, after all the money spent and rumors that had leaked out, there'd be trouble. And if it succeeded and they started selling it...

""What would it do to humans?"" Amos asked.

Barnes avoided his eyes. ""That’s one of the things I’m worried about,"" he said. ""I want to show you another pig.""

This pig was in a separate pen and looked even stranger. Its hair was thicker and black. The way it moved reminded Amos of something familiar, and it made his skin prickle.

""What’s wrong with it?"" he asked.

""It’s healthy except for the way it looks and acts.""

""Same litter and dosage?""

""Yes, sir—all of them got just one dose. The effects seem to be permanent.""

They were leaning over the fence, and the pig looked up at them. Its eyes were odd—not intelligent exactly, but different. It stood up on its hind legs and squealed like it was begging for attention. Amos reached down and patted it, and the squealing stopped.

It was standing too easily, and suddenly Amos realized what was familiar about it. He jerked his hand away, feeling a strong desire for soap and water. ""How long’s it been like this?""

""It’s changed a lot in the last week.""

Amos looked toward the lab doorway, where a large black tomcat sat watching them. ""Is the cat out here a lot?""

Barnes’ eyes went to the cat, widened, and turned back to the pig. He looked as ill as Amos felt.

When Amos got to his office, his sales manager, Bill Detrick, was waiting with a stuffed briefcase and a big smile. They exchanged pleasantries. ""Just get back?"" Amos asked.

""Early train. The planes were grounded again."" Detrick seemed full of energy, even though he’d probably rushed home and to the office without resting. He took out some papers and beamed. ""Wrote up the Peach Association.""

Amos knew he’d get the good news first. ""Fine, fine,"" he said. ""The whole year?""

""Yep. Got a check from the Almond Growers, too. All paid up now.""

""Good,"" said Amos, and waited.

Then it came. ""Say, I was talking to Frank Barnes about that new hormone he’s got and he seemed a little negative about it. When do you think we can have it?""

It was tempting to answer with false optimism, but Amos said, ""The slowest thing will be State and Federal testing and registration. I’d say not less than a year.""

Detrick nodded. ""Competition’s selling more and more stuff that’s not registered.""

""Fly-by-night outfits, and they’re always getting caught.""

Detrick smiled. ""Every night they fly away with more business.""

Amos managed a smile, though the argument was old and tiring. ""We’ll put it up to Buffalo if you want, Bill. You know I can’t okay it myself.""

Detrick dropped the subject. He wasn’t one to beat his head against a wall if there were ways around it. For the next hour, Amos listened to the troubles: competition had cut prices on this, upped active ingredients in that, put such and such a new product on the market (Whelan’s factories and warehouses already struggled with too many products, but Sales didn’t see that as their problem), and even the credit policies needed revising. But the worst was a fifteen-thousand-dollar claim for damage to pear trees, caused by a bad batch of Whelan’s arsenical insecticide.

Amos got rid of Detrick with a few definite concessions, some tentative ones, and some stand-offs. He made sure no one was waiting to see him and told his secretary he didn’t want to be bothered before lunch.

He had a lunch date with a customer and dreaded it—it meant three or four drinks and overeating, leading to an upset stomach later. But before then, he had a few minutes to try to get his mind straightened out. He mixed a glassful of the stuff he was supposed to take about now. The Compleat Executive, he thought; with physician and prescription attached. It didn’t seem possible that this same body had once breezed through everything from football to fried potatoes.

Mechanically, his mind on the lab’s pigs, he got a small bag of grain out of a desk drawer. He hoped nobody (except his secretary, of course) knew he wasted time feeding pigeons, but it helped his nerves, and he felt he had a right to one or two quirks.

They were already waiting. Some of them knew him and didn’t fly away when he opened the window and scattered grain on the ledge outside. A few ate from his hand.

It was a crisp day, but the sun slanting into the window was warm. He leaned there, watching the birds—more were circling in now—and looking out over the industrial part of the city. The rough shapes were softened by haze, and there was nothing noisy close by. He could almost imagine it as some country landscape.

He looked at his watch, sighed, pulled his head in, and shut the window. The air conditioner's hiss replaced the outside sounds.

Not even imagination could get rid of the city for long.

Going through the outer office, he saw that Alice Grant, his secretary, already had her lunch out on her desk. She was a young thirty, not very tall, and just slightly plump. She wore her blonde hair pulled back into a knot that didn’t make her look severe, and her features were well-formed and regular, if plain. Amos noticed a new bruise on one cheek and wondered how long she’d stay with her drunken husband. There were no children to hold her.

""I’ll probably be back late,"" he said. ""Anything for this afternoon?""

""Just Jim at two-thirty and the union agent at three.""

The lunch didn’t go too badly, smoothed over as the customer liked it, and Amos was feeling only a little uneasy when he got back.

A stormy session with his plant superintendent brought him back to his usual worries. Jim Glover was furious at having to take the fifteen-thousand-dollar claim, though it was clearly a factory error. He also fought hard before giving Amos a vague estimate of fifty thousand to equip for the new drug. He complained that Frank Barnes hadn’t given him enough information.

Amos was still shaken from that encounter when the union business agent arrived. The lunch was beginning to sit heavily, and he didn’t argue effectively. Not that it made much difference. The union was going to have a raise or else. By the time he’d squirmed through that interview and dictated a few letters, it was time to go home.

He hoped his wife would be out so he could take some of his prescription and relax, but she met him at the door with a verbal barrage. Their son, who was supposed to live with them, had gotten in trouble with the college crowd for drunk driving, and Amos was to get it fixed; the Templetons were coming for the weekend; her brother’s boy was graduating and thought he might accept a job with Amos.

She paused and studied him. ""I hope this isn’t one of your grumpy evenings. The Ashtons are coming for bridge.""

His patience slipped a little, and he expressed himself strongly on Wednesday night bridge, after a nightclub party on Tuesday and a get-together at someone’s house on Monday.

She stared at him without understanding. ""Well, they’re all business associates of yours. I wonder where you think you’d be without a wife who was willing to entertain.""

He’d been getting a lot of that lately; she was playing the role of Executive’s Wife for all it was worth. Since he couldn’t relax with his indigestion, there was only one thing to do. He headed for the bar.

""Now don’t get tipsy before dinner,"" she called after him.

He got through the evening well enough, helped by martinis, and the night that followed was no worse than most.

At nine the next morning, the call he’d been expecting from Buffalo came through. ""Hello, Stu,"" he said to the president of the company.

""Hello, Amos. Still morning out there, eh? How’s the family? Good. Say, Amos, a couple of things. This big factory charge. Production’s screaming.""

""It was definitely a bad batch, Stu.""

""Well, that’s it, then. Question is, how’d it happen?""

""Jim Glover says he needs another control chemist.""

""Hope you’re not practicing false economy out there.""

""We wanted to hire another man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it down.""

""You should have brought it to me personally if it was that important. It’s going to take a big bite out of your year’s profit. Been able to get your margin up any?""

Amos didn’t feel up to pointing out that Sales wanted lower prices and the union wanted higher wages, so that the margin would get even worse. He described a couple of minor economies he’d been able to find, then mentioned the contract with the Peach Association.

""Yes, I heard about that,"" said the president. ""Nice piece of business. By the way, how you coming on that animal hormone?""

That was the main reason for the call, of course. Detrick had probably phoned east and suggested that Amos was dragging his feet on a potential goldmine. ""I was going to call you on that, Stu. It’ll take a year to test and get registered, and--""

""Amos, I hope you’re not turning conservative on us.""

The message was clear; Amos countered automatically. ""You know me better than that, Stu. It’s the Legal Department I’m worried about. If they set up a lot of roadblocks, we may need you to help.""

""You know I'm always right behind you, Amos.""

That’s true, thought Amos as he hung up. Right behind me. A great place to help.

He knew exactly what to expect. If he tried to cut corners, the Legal Department would scream about proper testing and registration, Production would say he was pushing Jim Glover too hard, and everyone who could would take moral stands on the sidelines. A ton of paperwork would go to Buffalo to be distributed among fifty desks and expertly stalled.

Not to mention that this was no ordinary product. He realized for the first time that the Government might not let him produce it, let alone sell it. Even as a small percentage in feeds. If it was a narcotic, it could be misused.

His buzzer sounded, and he was surprised when Mrs. Grant announced Frank Barnes. It was out of character for Frank not to make a proper appointment first.

One look told Amos what was coming. He listened to Frank's resignation with a fraction of his mind while the rest of it pondered the way things were coming together.

Barnes stopped talking and Amos said mechanically, ""You've been part of the team for a long time, Frank. It's especially awkward to lose you just now."" It was cliché, but it didn’t matter; he wasn’t going to change the man’s mind anyway. He looked closer. The timidity was gone. So were the eyeglasses. A frightening thought struck him. ""You’ve taken some of that drug.""

Barnes grinned and handed a small vial full of powder across the desk, along with a file folder. ""Last night,"" he said. ""Between frustration with the job and curiosity about this stuff, I gave in to temptation.""

Amos took the vial and folder. ""What are these for?""

""So you can destroy them if you want to. I've fixed the lab records to make it look like a false alarm. You're holding all that's left of the whole program.""

Amos looked for signs of craziness and saw none. ""Do you feel all right?""

""Better than you can imagine. But let me tell you what you're up against. I can at least do that for you, Mr. Parry.""

""Thanks. Don’t you think you could call me Amos now?""

""Sure, Amos. First of all, you were right about that pig trying to imitate the cat. He couldn’t do much because he only had a pig’s brain to work with."" He stopped and grinned, seeing Amos’ expression. ""I’ll try to explain. What is an animal? Physically, I mean?""

Amos shook his head. ""You’ve got the floor.""

""All right. An animal is a colony of cells. Different kinds of cells form organs and do different things for the colony, but each cell has a life of its own, too. When it dies a new one of the same kind takes over. But what regulates the colony? What maintains the pattern?""

Amos waited.

""Part of it’s automatic replacement, cell for cell. But beyond that there’s a control; and it’s the unconscious mind."" He paused and studied Amos. ""You think I’m theorizing. I’m not. That drug broke down some barriers, and I see all this as you see your own fingers moving.""

Amos remembered the mention of hallucinations.

Barnes grinned again. ""Let’s say it’s only one percent awake and walled off from the conscious mind. What would happen if something removed the wall and woke up the other ninety-nine percent?""

Remembering the pig, it was impossible not to feel a cold seed of belief. Amos dreaded what was coming next; clearly, it would be a demonstration.

Barnes held out his hand, palm up. In a few seconds, a pink spot appeared. It turned red, oozed unsettlingly, and became a small pool of blood. Barnes let it stay for a moment, then wiped it off with a handkerchief. There was no more bleeding. ""That's something I can do fast,"" he said. ""I opened the pores, directed blood to them, then closed them again. Amos, do you believe in werewolves?""

Amos wanted to jump up and shout, ""No! You’re insane!"" but he could only sit staring.

""I could move that thumb around to the other side of my hand,"" Barnes said thoughtfully. ""I’m still exploring, but I don’t think even the bone would take too long. You’ll notice I don’t need glasses anymore.""

The buzzer buzzed. Amos jumped, and from habit answered. ""Bill Detrick and that customer are here, Mr. Parry,"" came Alice Grant’s voice.

""I—ask them to wait,"" he managed.

His mind was in a muddle; he needed time. ""You—Frank—will you stay for a few days?""

""Sure. I'm in no hurry now. And while you're thinking, let me give you a few hints. No more cripples or disease. No ugly people, unless they choose to be. And no law.""

""No—law?""

""How would you police such a world? A man could change his face at will, or his fingerprints. Even his teeth. Probably he could do things I can’t even think of yet.""

The buzzer went again, with Mrs. Grant’s subtle urgency. Amos ignored it, yet he hardly knew when Frank left the room.

He realized the chemist had done him a favor. The selfish thing would have been to keep the secret and the benefits all to himself; instead, he’d given Amos the choice.

But what was the choice? Suppressing the drug would cost him his job. There was no doubt about that.

He was standing with his back to the door when he heard it open. He turned and faced Detrick’s annoyed frown. ""Amos, we can’t keep this man waiting. He’s—""

All of Amos’ frustration and the new burden turned into rage. He ran toward Detrick. ""You baboon-faced huckster!"" he yelled. ""Get out! Get out! I’ll tell you when you can come in here!"" He barely caught his raised fist in time.

Detrick stood frozen, his face ridiculous. Then he came to life, ducked out, and pulled the door shut behind him.

Amos waited no longer; if he had to decide, he wanted the data firsthand. He spread out the file Barnes had left him and looked through it for dosages. Apparently it wasn’t critical, so he poured a little of the powder into a tumbler, added water, and drank it down. There was a mild alkaline taste, which he washed out of his mouth with more water. Then he sat down to wait.

A monotone seemed to be rattling off trivia; almost faster than he could grasp it, even though it was in his head and not in his ears: ""Paris green/calcium acetoarsenite/beetle invasion Texan cotton/paint pigment/obsolete/should eliminate/compensation claim/man probably faking infection/Detrick likes because we only source/felt like hitting him when we argued about it/correspondence Buffalo last year/they say keep/check how use as poison/damned wife—""

The last thought shocked his intellect awake. ""Hey!"" Intellect demanded. ""What's going on here?""

""Oh; you've broken through,"" said Unconscious. ""That was fast. Fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds since you drank it. Probable error, one-third second. I've only been awake a few minutes myself. Minute/sixty per hour/twenty-four hours day/days getting shorter/September/have raincoat in car/wife wants new car/raincoat sweats plasticizer/stinks/Hyatt used camphor—""

""Hold up a minute!"" cried Intellect.

""You want me to stop scanning?""

""Is that what you’re doing? Scanning what?""

""Memory banks, of course. Don’t you remember the book we read three years ago? 'Human brain estimated—' Oh, all right; I’ll slow down. You could follow me better if you’d let me grow some permanent direct connections.""

""Am I stopping you?""

""Well, not you, exactly. I’ll show you."" Unconscious began directing the growth of certain nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos could only follow it vaguely.

""Fear!"" screamed a soundless voice. ""Stop!""

""What was that?"" Intellect asked, startled.

""That was Id. He always fights any improvements, and I can’t override him.""

""Can I?""

""Of course; that’s mainly what you’re for. Wait till I get these connections finished and you’ll see the whole setup.""

""FEAR!"" shrieked Id. ""STOP! NO CHANGE!""

""SHUT UP!"" yelled Intellect.

It was strange being integrated; Amos found he was aware on two levels at once. While he responded normally to his external environment, a lightning inner vision saw everything in much greater detail. The blink of an eye, for instance, was an amazing project. Even as commands flashed out and before the muscles started to respond, extra blood was rushing into the area to nourish the working parts. Reports flowed back like battle assessments: these three muscles were on schedule; this was lagging; that was pulling too hard. An infinitesimal twinge of pain marked some minor accident, and correction began at once. A censor watched the whole operation and labeled each incoming report: trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; worth watching, record in temporary banks; trivial, do not...

He felt now that he could look forward to permanent health, and so far he didn’t seem to be losing his identity or becoming a moral monster (though certain previously buried urges—toward Alice Grant, for instance—were now rather embarrassingly uncovered). He was not, like Frank Barnes, inclined to slip out of the situation at once. He still felt the responsibility to make the decision.

He carried the vial of powder and the lab records home with him, smuggled them past his wife’s chatter (it didn’t bother him now) and hid them. He went out with her cheerfully to visit some people he didn’t like and found himself amused at them instead of annoyed. In general, he felt buoyant, and they stayed quite late.

When they did get home, an urgent message was waiting on the telephone recorder, and it jolted him. He grabbed up the hat and coat he’d just laid down.

""What is it?"" his wife demanded.

""I’ve got to go down to the plant."" He hesitated; it was hard to say the words that were charged with personal significance. ""The watchman found Frank Barnes dead in the laboratory.""

""Who?""

""Frank Barnes! My chief chemist!""

""Oh."" She looked at him, obviously concerned only with what effect, if any, it might have on her own circumstances. ""Why do you have to get mixed up in it?""

""I’m the boss, damn it!"" He left her standing there and ran for the garage.

The police were already at the plant when he arrived. Frank's body lay on the floor of his office, in a corner behind some file cabinets, face up.

""What was it?"" Amos asked the man from the coroner’s office, dreading the answer he expected.

The answer wasn’t what he expected. ""Heart attack.""

Amos wondered if they were mistaken. He looked around the office. Things weren’t in disarray; it looked as if Frank had simply lain down and died. ""When did you find him?"" he asked the watchman.

""A little after one. The door was closed and the lights were out, but I heard the cat yowling in here, so I came in to let it out, and saw the body.""

""Any family?"" one of the city men asked.

""No,"" said Amos slowly, ""he lived alone. I guess you might as well take him to the ... morgue. When can I call about the autopsy?""

""Try after lunch.""

Amos watched them carry Frank away. Then he put out the lights and closed up the laboratory. He told the watchman he’d be around for a while and went to his office to think.

As nearly as he knew, Frank had taken the drug less than twenty-four hours before he had. Death had come late at night, which meant Frank had been working overtime. Why? And why hadn’t he been able to save himself?

""Not logical,"" his unconscious stated firmly. ""He should have felt it coming and made repairs.""

""This whole thing’s a delusion,"" said Amos dully, aloud.

""No, it isn’t,"" said a peculiar voice behind him.

He turned and saw the black tomcat grinning up at him. He gasped, wondering if he were completely insane, but in a flash understanding came. ""Frank!""

""Well, don’t act so surprised. I can tell that you took some yourself.""

""Yes—but how—""

""I thought it would be an easy life, and I want to stay around here and watch things for a while. It ought to be fun.""

""But how?""

""I anesthetized the cat and grew a bridge into his skull. It took five hours to transfer the bulk of my personality. It’s odd, but it blended right in with his.""

""But—your speech!""

""I’ve made some changes. I’m omnivorous now, too, not just carnivorous—or will be in a few more hours. I can go into the hills and live on grass, or grow back into a man, or whatever I like.""

Amos consulted his own inwardness again. ""Is this possible? Can a human mind be compressed into a cat’s brain?""

""Sure,"" said Unconscious, ""if you’re willing to junk all the excess.""

He thought about it. ""So you’re going to stay around and watch,"" he said to the cat—no, Frank. ""An intriguing idea. My family’s taken care of, and nobody’ll really miss me.""

""Except Alice Grant,"" said Frank cattily. ""I’ve seen the way you look at her. The cat part of me has, I mean. And she looks back, too, when you aren’t watching.""

""Well,"" said Amos. ""Hm. Maybe we can do something there too.""

His own transformation took a lot longer than five hours; he had a much bigger job of changes to finish. It was nearly two months before he got back to the plant.

He peered in through the window at Detrick, who’d inherited Amos’ old office. Detrick was chewing out a salesman. Amos knew what would be happening now; Detrick's ambitious but flawed expansion would have gotten the division all tangled up. In fact, with his sharp new eyes, Amos could read part of a letter from Buffalo that lay on the desk. It was quite critical of Detrick’s profit margin.

The salesman Detrick had on the carpet was a good man, and Amos wondered if he was to blame for whatever it was about. Maybe Detrick was just preparing to throw him to the wolves. A man could hang on a long time like that, shifting the blame to his subordinates.

The salesman was finally excused, and Detrick sat alone with all the frustration and selfish scheming plain on his face. No, Amos thought, I’m not going to turn this drug loose on the world for a while. Not while there are people like Detrick around.

There were no other pigeons on the window ledge except himself and Alice; the rest had stopped coming when Amos disappeared and the feeding ended. For that matter, they tended to avoid him and Alice, possibly because of the abnormal size, especially around the head, and the other differences.

He noticed that Alice was changing the color of her feet again. Just like a woman, he thought fondly.

""Come on, Pigeon,"" he said, ""let’s go somewhere else. This tightwad Detrick isn’t going to give us anything to eat.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the moral and ethical dilemma faced by Amos Parry, the regional manager at Whelan, Inc., regarding the use and potential distribution of a powerful new drug that has transformative effects. This drug, initially disguised as a hormone for farm animals, is revealed to be a chemical derivative of mescaline, which can unlock immense capabilities in both animals and humans.

Amos is confronted with several layers of conflict:

1. **Moral and Ethical Responsibility**: Amos grapples with the implications of releasing such a potent drug into the market. The drug has the potential to alter human consciousness and physical form significantly, as demonstrated by Frank Barnes, who uses it to transfer his consciousness into a cat. Amos must decide whether to suppress the drug, which could mean losing his job, or to proceed with its development and face the potential consequences.

2. **Professional Pressure**: Amos faces pressure from his company’s sales team and the president to expedite the development and sale of the drug. This pressure is compounded by competition from other companies and the need to improve profit margins, creating a conflict between corporate interests and ethical considerations.

3. **Personal Transformation**: After taking the drug himself, Amos experiences a personal transformation that changes his perspective and capabilities. This internal conflict involves reconciling his new understanding and abilities with his former identity and responsibilities.

4. **Decision to Act or Suppress**: Ultimately, Amos must decide whether to act on his newfound capabilities and the knowledge of the drug's potential or to suppress it to prevent potential misuse and societal chaos.

These conflicts highlight the broader themes of corporate ethics, the consequences of scientific advancement, and the responsibilities of those in positions of power.

010.txt,"There was a letter that caused a lot of talk, and it was written a long time ago, on July 9, 1685, from a place called Ringwood. The letter was from James Scot, the Duke of Monmouth, who was involved in a dangerous rebellion against the King. Monmouth had written to the King, pleading to speak with him because he claimed he had something important that would calm the King forever. He promised that if the King spared his life, he would serve him loyally.

Lawrence Hyde, the Earl of Rochester, who was the Lord High Treasurer of England, showed this letter to a man who had been with Monmouth during his last council in Bridgewater. Rochester laughed at Monmouth's desperate plea for mercy. Some people thought Monmouth had a secret he would reveal to save himself, but since he said nothing, they believed he was only trying to trick the King into sparing him.

The man who saw the letter wanted to defend Monmouth’s memory but knew he had to keep the secret. He knew it was something that, out of pity, he should never reveal. The man thought about how Monmouth was forgotten, except by those who had once called him King. He remembered his time with Monmouth during the rebellion and the years afterward. He often thought about Monmouth, whose life was filled with pleasure and whose death was filled with sorrow.

This man, once a writer for Monmouth, was now working for Rochester. He copied the letter and brought it home, planning to write about the secret behind it. He didn’t intend to show it to anyone, just to relieve his own heart of the memory that haunted him for years.

When Monmouth was captured in 1685, the King was cruel to him. He had Monmouth brought to him, even though he had decided to punish him harshly. Monmouth begged for his life, saying he had something important to reveal, but the King didn't believe him. Some thought Monmouth's secret involved powerful people, but it was never discovered. The man who knew Monmouth believed in his sincerity and thought the secret was tragic, but he had promised never to tell.

In the last council at Bridgewater, Monmouth was reluctant to lead the rebellion. He was brave but gentle, and he loved life too much to risk it. He was persuaded by people around him, including his beloved Harriet Wentworth, to take on the challenge. They wanted to make him King, but Monmouth was unsure and filled with doubt.

As they marched through England, Monmouth’s followers grew in number, but they were poorly equipped. Monmouth hesitated at key moments, and his forces suffered from lack of supplies and support. They were eventually defeated, and Monmouth was captured.

In his final moments, Monmouth wrote letters, hoping to save his life with his secret. But when he faced the King, he said nothing and was executed. The man who knew him was sad for Monmouth, who had brought misery to many but was loved by some. He kept the secret to the end, even as he remembered Monmouth’s head held up, so unlike the Stewart Kings.

**A BIOGRAPHY**

**THE EARL OF STRAFFORD**

Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, was a powerful man who fell from grace and was executed. He was a close adviser to King Charles I, but the King abandoned him when the people called for his death. Strafford was judged and condemned by the people, and even the King could not save him.

Strafford was from a noble family and had a strong desire to serve his country. He was educated at Cambridge and traveled in Europe. He was elected to Parliament and became an important figure, but he chose to support the King over the rising power of Parliament.

Strafford was made Lord Deputy of Ireland and tried to bring order to the troubled country. However, his efforts were seen as despotic, and he made many enemies. He was eventually arrested and put on trial for treason.

His trial was dramatic, with Strafford defending himself eloquently. Despite his efforts, he was found guilty, and the public demanded his execution. The King was pressured into signing Strafford's death warrant, but he never forgave himself for it.

Strafford faced his death with dignity, wearing his finest clothes. He was executed in May 1641, a victim of the political turmoil of his time.

**A POOR SPANISH LODGING**

**PHILIP WHARTON, DUKE OF WHARTON**

A young man, Philip Wharton, sat in a small, shabby room in Spain. He was once a wealthy and famous duke in England, but now he was penniless and ill. He had lived a life of pleasure and extravagance, and it had caught up with him.

He was dressed in worn clothes and was very weak. He remembered the doctors warning him that he was ruining his health, but he hadn't listened. Now, he was dying in a foreign country, far from the luxury he once knew.

Despite his situation, he had no regrets. He had lived his life according to his own philosophy, enjoying every moment without thinking of the consequences. He had no fear of death and no belief in the afterlife.

As he sat in the quiet inn, he thought about his past without remorse. He had been unfaithful and deceived many, but he had never been dishonest in games or bets and had always been kind to animals.

He was lovable and had been adored by many, despite his flaws. He was content with his life and ready to face the end, feeling grateful to die in the sun.

A woman entered the room, a dancer he had known in Venice. She seemed to remind him of his past loves, but he couldn't place her. She told him stories of their times together, but he was not afraid or ashamed. He wanted to die with the memory of his joyful life.

He began to dream of his past, seeing the beautiful moments and the women he had loved. He was at peace with his choices and ready to face death.

**DEFEAT**

**EDWARD PLANTAGENET**

Edward Plantagenet, Prince of Wales, sat defeated in Bordeaux. He had fought bravely in the wars, but now he was sick and unable to save Acquitaine. His once-glorious life was filled with failure, and he was filled with regret.

The Prince had been a hero in his youth, but now he was worn down by illness. He thought of his son, Edward, who was also sick. The boy was his hope for the future, but he feared that he, too, would die.

Edward was haunted by a massacre he had ordered in Limoges, and he felt the weight of those deaths on his soul. He was tired and no longer able to fight. His brother, Johan of Gaunt, took over his duties, but Edward felt his life slipping away.

He worried for his son and prayed for him to become a great king. But the boy's health worsened, and Edward was filled with despair.

The Prince's life was ending in bitterness, and he saw no future for himself or his family. He had once been full of hope and glory, but now he was a shadow of his former self.

Edward's son died before they could return to England, leaving the Prince to face his own death with a heavy heart.

**TWILIGHT**

**LUCREZIA BORGIA, DUCHESS D’ESTE**

Three women stood by a pool in the gardens of a palace in Ferrara. The center woman was Lucrezia Borgia, once known for her beauty and power. Now, she was old and sick, her face painted to hide her age.

Lucrezia was deep in thought, gazing at her reflection in the water. Her life had been filled with intrigue and scandal, but she had lived quietly in Ferrara for many years.

A young man, Orsini, approached her. He was surprised to see her alone and struck by her age. Lucrezia asked him to tell her she was beautiful, but he hesitated. She was no longer the woman she once was.

They talked, and she confided in him that she was sick and wished to return to Rome. She was haunted by her past and the crimes associated with her family.

Orsini felt a strange fear of her, sensing the evil that surrounded her. He left the garden, troubled by the encounter.

Lucrezia was left alone, pondering her life and the choices she had made. She was a woman who had once ruled with charm and ruthlessness, but now she faced the twilight of her years with regret.

**THE CAMP OUTSIDE NAMUR**

**DON JUAN OF AUSTRIA**

Don Juan of Austria was a famous commander, known for his victory at Lepanto. But now, he was ill and abandoned by the King. He lay in a camp outside Namur, feeling trapped and forgotten.

His friend and secretary, Escovedo, had been assassinated, and Don Juan feared he would meet the same fate. His army was weak, and he was surrounded by enemies.

Don Juan wrote letters, hoping for help, but none came. He was left to languish in the camp, tormented by fever and despair.

He was haunted by thoughts of his past glory and the betrayal by those he trusted. He feared the Prince of Parma, who he believed was sent to replace him.

As his illness worsened, Don Juan became more desperate. He felt abandoned by God and man, and he struggled with the knowledge that he was being poisoned.

In his final moments, Don Juan thought of his ambition and dreams, now shattered. He died alone in the camp, a victim of political intrigue and betrayal.

**THE POLANDER**

A simple man from Poland, known as the Polander, came to London to serve Count Conningsmarke. He was loyal to his master, Captain Vratz, who had been kind to him.

The Polander found himself involved in a plot to kill a man named Thynne. Vratz asked him to help, and the Polander, trusting his master, agreed.

Together with Vratz and another man, Stern, they ambushed Thynne's coach. The Polander fired the fatal shot, not fully understanding the consequences.

The three men were arrested and taken to trial. The Polander was confused and frightened, but he trusted Vratz, who promised to take the blame.

In the end, Vratz was executed, and the Polander was left to face his fate. He had been a pawn in a deadly game, and he paid the price for his loyalty.

**THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF GRACE ENDICOTT**

Grace Endicott was a young woman from Bedford who became entangled in a scandal. She was accused of witchcraft and poisoning her father, who had refused to let her see a preacher she admired.

Grace had been a lively and beautiful girl, but she became devoted to her faith and a preacher named John Bunyan. Her father disapproved, and she was caught between her love for her faith and her family.

When her father died, Grace was accused of murder. Her trial was sensational, and she was condemned to death.

Before her execution, Grace wrote a letter confessing to her sins and her love for Bunyan. She was hanged, leaving behind a story of passion and tragedy.

**THE CUP OF CHICORY WATER**

**“MADAME SE MEURT! MADAME EST MORTE!”**

Madame was a celebrated princess, admired for her beauty and charm. She was involved in a secret treaty between England and France, but her triumph was short-lived.

One day, after drinking chicory water, she fell ill with terrible pain. Her husband, Monsieur, and others watched as her condition worsened.

Madame believed she was poisoned, but the doctors insisted it was a chill. She suffered for hours, surrounded by people who were powerless to help her.

As she lay dying, Madame thought of her past loves and triumphs. She had been adored and envied, but now she faced death alone.

Her final thoughts were of the King, who had loved her, and she wished for his presence. But he had left, and she died with a sense of betrayal and regret.

**THE BURNING OF THE VANITIES**

**GIROLAMO SAVONAROLA IN FLORENCE, 1497**

Frà Girolamo Savonarola was a Dominican friar who preached against the excesses of Florence. He called for the burning of vanities, and the people responded by gathering their worldly possessions for destruction.

The city was filled with excitement as the bonfire was prepared. Savonarola watched as the people danced and sang, burning their treasures in a show of repentance.

But not everyone was pleased with the Friar's influence. A stranger confronted him, warning that the people might turn against him, just as they had turned against the Medici.

Savonarola was troubled by the encounter, but he believed in his mission. He prayed for the strength to continue his work and trusted in the people's devotion.

The bonfire blazed, and the vanities of Florence were reduced to ashes. Savonarola remained steadfast in his faith, hoping to guide the city to a better future.

**A WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE**

**MADAME LA COMTESSE DU BARRY**

Madame du Barry was once the mistress of King Louis XV, living in luxury and power. But during the French Revolution, she was arrested and condemned to death.

In prison, Madame du Barry struggled to comprehend her fate. She had lived a life of pleasure, and now she faced the guillotine.

She tried to appeal to the people, claiming she was one of them, but her pleas were ignored. As she was led to her execution, she was overcome with terror.

Unlike the aristocrats who faced death with dignity, Madame du Barry was consumed by fear. She screamed for mercy, but there was none.

Her death was a spectacle, and she was remembered as the only one who showed cowardice in the face of the guillotine.

**THE ARISTOCRAT**

**MARIE JEAN NICOLAS CARITAT, MARQUIS DE CONDORCET**

The Marquis de Condorcet was a nobleman and philosopher who supported the French Revolution. But as the revolution turned violent, he became a target and was forced to flee.

Condorcet wandered the countryside, hiding from those who sought his death. Starving and exhausted, he stopped at an inn, hoping for food and rest.

His appearance betrayed his noble birth, and the innkeeper became suspicious. Condorcet tried to hide his identity, but he was recognized and arrested.

In prison, Condorcet faced the reality of his situation. He had once dreamed of a bright future for France, but now he was a victim of the chaos he had helped create.

Knowing he would be executed, Condorcet took poison and died on the prison floor, a tragic figure caught in the turmoil of his time.

**THE BETROTHED OF PEDRO EL JUSTICAR**

**JEHANNE PLANTAGENET**

Jehanne Plantagenet was a princess who was betrothed to Pedro the Cruel, King of Castile. But she died before the marriage could take place.

She was a beautiful and gentle woman, loved by those around her. But she was haunted by visions of Pedro’s first wife, who had died mysteriously.

Jehanne confided in her lady-in-waiting, expressing her fears of marrying a cruel king. She was also in love with a knight, Sir Paon de Brambre, and wished to see him before she died.

The two met secretly, and Jehanne professed her love for him. She knew she would not live to marry Pedro and asked Sir Paon to remember her.

That night, Jehanne died peacefully, and her spirit went to join the first wife of Pedro the Cruel. She was buried with honor, leaving behind a tale of love and fate.

**THE MACEDONIAN GROOM**

**THE EMPEROR MICHAEL III**

An old monk in a monastery in Armenia recounted the story of the Emperor Michael III and his rise to power. Michael had been a groom who gained favor with the Emperor and became his chamberlain.

With the help of Eudocia Ingerina, Michael plotted to overthrow the Emperor and become ruler himself. Michael was known for his strength and cunning, and he succeeded in his plan.

Michael’s reign was marked by extravagance and revelry, but also by cruelty. He was ruthless in his pursuit of power and had no qualms about eliminating those who stood in his way.

The old monk, who had once served Michael, was blinded for witnessing the emperor's crimes. He remembered the opulence and corruption of Michael's court and hoped for redemption in the afterlife.

**THE PRISONER**

**SOPHIA DOROTHEA OF ZELL**

Sophia Dorothea was a princess who had been imprisoned for thirty-two years in a castle in Hanover. She was accused of an affair with a Swedish adventurer and repudiated by her husband, who became King of England.

Confined to Schloss Ahlden, Sophia Dorothea lived a life of monotony and isolation. She watched the road, hoping for freedom, but none came.

Her husband never forgave her, and her children grew up without her. She became a forgotten figure, a memory of a scandal long past.

Sophia Dorothea remembered her youth, her beauty, and the love she had lost. She was haunted by the past, and her heart was filled with bitterness and regret.

As she grew old, she accepted her fate. She had lived a life of confinement, but she held on to the memory of her love.

**THE YELLOW INTAGLIO**

**GIOVANNI PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA**

Giovanni Pico della Mirandola was a brilliant scholar and nobleman, known for his learning and beauty. But as he lay dying, he realized the emptiness of his worldly achievements.

He was visited by Frà Girolamo Savonarola, who urged him to turn to God. Giovanni wished to join the brotherhood of St. Mark, but he was too weak to leave his chamber.

As the French army entered Florence, Giovanni felt the end approaching. He cast aside his treasures and prepared to meet his fate.

Frà Girolamo promised to bury him in the habit of the friars, and Giovanni found peace in the thought of a humble grave.

In his final moments, Giovanni remembered the beauty of the world, but he let it go. He died with the crucifix in his hands, ready to face the judgment of God.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story of James Scott, the Duke of Monmouth, revolves around his desperate attempt to save his life by appealing to the King after his failed rebellion. The key tension lies in whether Monmouth truly possesses a secret that could alter his fate or if his plea is merely a ruse to gain clemency. This conflict is further complicated by the perspectives of those around him, including the man who wishes to defend Monmouth's memory but is bound by a promise to keep the secret, and the King, who is skeptical of Monmouth's sincerity and ultimately dismisses his claims.

Monmouth's internal struggle is also significant, as he grapples with the pressures and doubts surrounding his leadership during the rebellion. Despite his bravery and the affection of his followers, he is hesitant and reluctant to fully commit to the cause, which contributes to the rebellion's failure and his subsequent capture and execution. This personal conflict highlights Monmouth's tragic journey from a life of pleasure to a sorrowful death, underscoring themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of ambition.",Would you risk everything in a rebellion if you weren't sure you wanted to lead?

011.txt,"Hellman picked the last radish out of the can using a pair of dividers. He showed it to Casker with a little flourish, then placed it carefully on the workbench next to the razor.

""Not much of a meal for two grown men,"" Casker said, dropping into one of the ship's padded crash chairs.

""If you'd like to give up your share—"" Hellman began to suggest.

Casker quickly shook his head. Hellman smiled, picked up the razor, and inspected its edge closely.

""Don't take forever with it,"" Casker said, glancing at the ship's instruments. They were nearing a red dwarf star, which had the only planet-bearing system in the area. ""We need to finish eating before we get much closer.""

Hellman made a practice cut on the radish, squinting along the razor's edge. Casker leaned in, mouth open. Hellman carefully sliced the radish in half.

""Will you say grace?"" Hellman asked.

Casker grumbled something and popped one half into his mouth. Hellman chewed more slowly. The sharp taste seemed to explode on his neglected taste buds.

""Not much to fill us up,"" Hellman said.

Casker didn't respond. He was busy studying the red dwarf.

As Hellman finished the radish, he stifled a sigh. Their last meal had been three days ago—if you could call two biscuits and a cup of water a meal. This radish, now swallowed into the emptiness of their stomachs, was the last bit of food on the ship.

""Two planets,"" Casker said. ""One's burned to a crisp.""

""Then we'll land on the other.""

Casker nodded and entered a deceleration spiral into the ship's navigation.

Hellman found himself wondering for the hundredth time where the mistake had been. Did he write down the food orders wrong when they got supplies at Calao station? He had been focusing on the mining equipment. Or did the ground crew just forget to load those last crucial cases?

He tightened his belt to the fourth new notch he had made.

Speculation was useless. No matter the reason, they were in trouble. Ironically, they had more than enough fuel to get back to Calao. But they would be nothing but skeletons by the time they reached it.

""We're coming in now,"" Casker said.

To make matters worse, this unexplored region of space had few stars and even fewer planets. There might be a small chance of finding more water, but the odds of finding anything edible were slim.

""Look at that place,"" Casker growled.

Hellman shook himself out of his thoughts.

The planet looked like a round, gray-brown porcupine. The spines of countless needle-sharp mountains sparkled in the red dwarf's weak light. As they spiraled lower, circling the planet, the sharp mountains seemed to reach up to meet them.

""It can't be all mountains,"" Hellman said.

""It's not.""

Sure enough, there were oceans and lakes, with jagged island-mountains poking out of them. But there was no sign of flat land, no hint of civilization, or even animal life.

""At least it has an oxygen atmosphere,"" Casker said.

Their deceleration spiral took them around the planet, cutting lower into the atmosphere, slowing them down. Still, there was nothing but mountains and lakes and oceans and more mountains.

On the eighth pass, Hellman spotted a lone building on a mountain top. Casker braked hard, making the hull glow red hot. On the eleventh pass, they made a landing approach.

""Odd place to build,"" Casker muttered.

The building was doughnut-shaped and fit perfectly over the top of the mountain. There was a wide, flat area around it, which Casker scorched as he landed the ship.

From the air, the building had seemed merely big. On the ground, it was enormous. Hellman and Casker walked up to it slowly. Hellman had his burner ready, but there was no sign of life.

""This planet must be abandoned,"" Hellman whispered.

""Anyone in their right mind would leave this place,"" Casker said. ""There are enough good planets around without anyone trying to live on a needle point.""

They reached the door. Hellman tried to open it and found it locked. He looked back at the amazing view of mountains.

""You know,"" he said, ""when this planet was still molten, it must have been affected by several huge moons that are now broken up. The strains, both outside and inside, twisted it into its current spiky shape and—""

""Come off it,"" Casker said rudely. ""You were a librarian before you decided to get rich on uranium.""

Hellman shrugged and burned a hole in the door lock. They waited.

The only sound on the mountain top was the growling of their stomachs.

They entered.

The huge wedge-shaped room was a warehouse, it seemed. Goods were piled to the ceiling, scattered over the floor, stacked haphazardly against the walls. There were boxes and containers of all sizes and shapes, some big enough to hold an elephant, others the size of thimbles.

Near the door was a dusty pile of books. Hellman immediately bent down to examine them.

""There must be food somewhere in here,"" Casker said, his face lighting up for the first time in a week. He began to open the nearest box.

""This is interesting,"" Hellman said, discarding all the books except one.

""Let's eat first,"" Casker said, ripping the top off the box. Inside was a brownish dust. Casker looked at it, sniffed, and made a face.

""Very interesting indeed,"" Hellman said, leafing through the book.

""Hellman! Will you kindly drop that book and help me find some food?""

""Food?"" Hellman repeated, looking up. ""What makes you think there's anything to eat here? For all you know, this could be a paint factory.""

""It's a warehouse!"" Casker shouted.

He opened a kidney-shaped can and lifted out a soft purple stick. It hardened quickly and crumbled to dust as he tried to smell it. He scooped up a handful of the dust and brought it to his mouth.

""That might be extract of strychnine,"" Hellman said casually.

Casker abruptly dropped the dust and wiped his hands.

""After all,"" Hellman pointed out, ""granted that this is a warehouse—a cache, if you wish—we don't know what the former inhabitants considered good food. Paris green salad, perhaps, with sulfuric acid as dressing.""

""All right,"" Casker said, ""but we gotta eat. What're you going to do about all this?"" He gestured at the hundreds of boxes, cans, and bottles.

""The thing to do,"" Hellman said briskly, ""is to make a qualitative analysis on four or five samples. We could start out with a simple titration, sublimate the chief ingredient, see if it forms a precipitate, work out its molecular makeup from—""

""Hellman, you don't know what you're talking about. You're a librarian, remember? And I'm a correspondence school pilot. We don't know anything about titrations and sublimations.""

""I know,"" Hellman said, ""but we should. It's the right way to go about it.""

""Sure. In the meantime, though, just until a chemist drops in, what'll we do?""

""This might help us,"" Hellman said, holding up the book. ""Do you know what it is?""

""No,"" Casker said, keeping a tight grip on his patience.

""It's a pocket dictionary and guide to the Helg language.""

""Helg?""

""The planet we're on. The symbols match up with those on the boxes.""

Casker raised an eyebrow. ""Never heard of Helg.""

""I don't believe the planet has ever had any contact with Earth,"" Hellman said. ""This dictionary isn't Helg-English. It's Helg-Aloombrigian.""

Casker remembered that Aloombrigia was the home planet of a small, adventurous reptilian race, out near the center of the Galaxy.

""How come you can read Aloombrigian?"" Casker asked.

""Oh, being a librarian isn't a completely useless profession,"" Hellman said modestly. ""In my spare time—""

""Yeah. Now how about—""

""Do you know,"" Hellman said, ""the Aloombrigians probably helped the Helgans leave their planet and find another. They sell services like that. In which case, this building very likely is a food cache!""

""Suppose you start translating,"" Casker suggested wearily, ""and maybe find us something to eat.""

They opened boxes until they found a likely-looking substance. Laboriously, Hellman translated the symbols on it.

""Got it,"" he said. ""It reads: 'USE SNIFFNERS—THE BETTER ABRASIVE.'""

""Doesn't sound edible,"" Casker said.

""I'm afraid not.""

They found another, which read: VIGROOM! FILL ALL YOUR STOMACHS, AND FILL THEM RIGHT!

""What kind of animals do you suppose these Helgans were?"" Casker asked.

Hellman shrugged his shoulders.

The next label took almost fifteen minutes to translate. It read: ARGOSEL MAKES YOUR THUDRA ALL TIZZY. CONTAINS THIRTY ARPS OF RAMSTAT PULZ, FOR SHELL LUBRICATION.

""There must be something here we can eat,"" Casker said with a note of desperation.

""I hope so,"" Hellman replied.

After two hours, they were no closer. They had translated dozens of titles and sniffed so many substances that their noses had given up in disgust.

""Let's talk this over,"" Hellman said, sitting on a box marked: VORMITISH—GOOD AS IT SOUNDS!

""Sure,"" Casker said, sprawling out on the floor. ""Talk.""

""If we could deduce what kind of creatures inhabited this planet, we'd know what kind of food they ate, and whether it's likely to be edible for us.""

""All we do know is that they wrote a lot of lousy advertising copy.""

Hellman ignored that. ""What kind of intelligent beings would evolve on a planet that is all mountains?""

""Stupid ones!"" Casker said.

That was no help. But Hellman found that he couldn't draw any inferences from the mountains. They didn't tell him if the late Helgans ate silicates or proteins or iodine-base foods or anything.

""Now look,"" Hellman said, ""we'll have to work this out by pure logic—Are you listening to me?""

""Sure,"" Casker said.

""Okay. There's an old proverb that covers our situation perfectly: 'One man's meat is another man's poison.'""

""Yeah,"" Casker said. He was positive his stomach had shrunk to approximately the size of a marble.

""We can assume, first, that their meat is our meat.""

Casker wrenched himself away from a vision of five juicy roast beefs dancing tantalizingly before him. ""What if their meat is our poison? What then?""

""Then,"" Hellman said, ""we will assume that their poison is our meat.""

""And what happens if their meat and their poison are our poison?""

""We starve.""

""All right,"" Casker said, standing up. ""Which assumption do we start with?""

""Well, there's no sense in asking for trouble. This is an oxygen planet, if that means anything. Let's assume that we can eat some basic food of theirs. If we can't, we'll start on their poisons.""

""If we live that long,"" Casker said.

Hellman began to translate labels. They discarded such brands as ANDROGYNITES' DELIGHT AND VERBELL—FOR LONGER, CURLIER, MORE SENSITIVE ANTENNAE, until they found a small gray box, about six inches by three by three. It was called VALKORIN'S UNIVERSAL TASTE TREAT, FOR ALL DIGESTIVE CAPACITIES.

""This looks as good as any,"" Hellman said. He opened the box.

Casker leaned over and sniffed. ""No odor.""

Within the box, they found a rectangular, rubbery red block. It quivered slightly, like jelly.

""Bite into it,"" Casker said.

""Me?"" Hellman asked. ""Why not you?""

""You picked it.""

""I prefer just looking at it,"" Hellman said with dignity. ""I'm not too hungry.""

""I'm not either,"" Casker said.

They sat on the floor and stared at the jellylike block. After ten minutes, Hellman yawned, leaned back, and closed his eyes.

""All right, coward,"" Casker said bitterly. ""I'll try it. Just remember, though, if I'm poisoned, you'll never get off this planet. You don't know how to pilot.""

""Just take a little bite, then,"" Hellman advised.

Casker leaned over and stared at the block. Then he prodded it with his thumb.

The rubbery red block giggled.

""Did you hear that?"" Casker yelped, leaping back.

""I didn't hear anything,"" Hellman said, his hands shaking. ""Go ahead.""

Casker prodded the block again. It giggled louder, this time with a disgusting little simper.

""Okay,"" Casker said, ""what do we try next?""

""Next? What's wrong with this?""

""I don't eat anything that giggles,"" Casker stated firmly.

""Now listen to me,"" Hellman said. ""The creatures who manufactured this might have been trying to create an aesthetic sound as well as a pleasant shape and color. That giggle is probably only for the amusement of the eater.""

""Then bite into it yourself,"" Casker offered.

Hellman glared at him, but made no move toward the rubbery block. Finally, he said, ""Let's move it out of the way.""

They pushed the block over to a corner. It lay there giggling softly to itself.

""Now what?"" Casker said.

Hellman looked around at the jumbled stacks of incomprehensible alien goods. He noticed a door on either side of the room.

""Let's have a look in the other sections,"" he suggested.

Casker shrugged his shoulders apathetically.

Slowly, they trudged to the door in the left wall. It was locked, and Hellman burned it open with the ship's burner.

It was a wedge-shaped room, piled with incomprehensible alien goods.

The hike back across the room seemed like miles, but they made it only slightly out of wind. Hellman blew out the lock, and they looked in.

It was a wedge-shaped room, piled with incomprehensible alien goods.

""All the same,"" Casker said sadly, and closed the door.

""Evidently there's a series of these rooms going completely around the building,"" Hellman said. ""I wonder if we should explore them.""

Casker calculated the distance around the building, compared it with his remaining strength, and sat down heavily on a long gray object.

""Why bother?"" he asked.

Hellman tried to collect his thoughts. Certainly, he should be able to find a key of some sort, a clue that would tell him what they could eat. But where was it?

He examined the object Casker was sitting on. It was about the size and shape of a large coffin, with a shallow depression on top. It was made of a hard, corrugated substance.

""What do you suppose this is?"" Hellman asked.

""Does it matter?""

Hellman glanced at the symbols painted on the side of the object, then looked them up in his dictionary.

""Fascinating,"" he murmured, after a while.

""Is it something to eat?"" Casker asked, with a faint glimmering of hope.

""No, you are sitting on something called THE MOROG CUSTOM SUPER TRANSPORT FOR THE DISCRIMINATING HELGAN WHO DESIRES THE BEST IN VERTICAL TRANSPORTATION. It's a vehicle!""

""Oh,"" Casker said dully.

""This is important! Look at it! How does it work?""

Casker wearily climbed off the Morog Custom Super Transport and looked it over carefully. He traced four almost invisible separations on its four corners. ""Retractable wheels, probably, but I don't see—""

Hellman read on. ""It says to give it three amphus of high-gain Integor fuel, then a van of Tonder lubrication, and not to run it over three thousand Ruls for the first fifty mungus.""

""Let's find something to eat,"" Casker said.

""Don't you see how important this is?"" Hellman asked. ""This could solve our problem. If we could deduce the alien logic inherent in constructing this vehicle, we might know the Helgan thought pattern. This, in turn, would give us an insight into their nervous systems, which would imply their biochemical makeup.""

Casker stood still, trying to decide whether he had enough strength left to strangle Hellman.

""For example,"" Hellman said, ""what kind of vehicle would be used in a place like this? Not one with wheels, since everything is up and down. Anti-gravity? Perhaps, but what kind of anti-gravity? And why did the inhabitants devise a boxlike form instead—""

Casker decided sadly that he didn't have enough strength to strangle Hellman, no matter how pleasant it might be. Very quietly, he said, ""Kindly stop making like a scientist. Let's see if there isn't something we can gulp down.""

""All right,"" Hellman said sulkily.

Casker watched his partner wander off among the cans, bottles, and cases. He wondered vaguely where Hellman got the energy and decided that he was just too cerebral to know when he was starving.

""Here's something,"" Hellman called out, standing in front of a large yellow vat.

""What does it say?"" Casker asked.

""Little bit hard to translate. But rendered freely, it reads: MORISHILLE'S VOOZY, WITH LACTO-ECTO ADDED FOR A NEW TASTE SENSATION. EVERYONE DRINKS VOOZY. GOOD BEFORE AND AFTER MEALS, NO UNPLEASANT AFTER-EFFECTS. GOOD FOR CHILDREN! THE DRINK OF THE UNIVERSE!""

""That sounds good,"" Casker admitted, thinking that Hellman might not be so stupid after all.

""This should tell us once and for all if their meat is our meat,"" Hellman said. ""This Voozy seems to be the closest thing to a universal drink I've found yet.""

""Maybe,"" Casker said hopefully, ""maybe it's just plain water!""

""We'll see."" Hellman pried open the lid with the edge of the burner.

Inside the vat was a crystal-clear liquid.

""No odor,"" Casker said, bending over the vat.

The crystal liquid lifted to meet him.

Casker retreated so rapidly that he fell over a box. Hellman helped him to his feet, and they approached the vat again. As they came near, the liquid lifted itself three feet into the air and moved toward them.

""What've you done now?"" Casker asked, moving back carefully. The liquid flowed slowly over the side of the vat. It began to flow toward him.

""Hellman!"" Casker shrieked.

Hellman was standing to one side, sweating, reading his dictionary with a preoccupied frown.

""Guess I bumbled the translation,"" he said.

""Do something!"" Casker shouted. The liquid was trying to back him into a corner.

""Nothing I can do,"" Hellman said, reading on. ""Ah, here's the error. It doesn't say 'Everyone drinks Voozy.' Wrong subject. 'Voozy drinks everyone.' That tells us something! The Helgans must have soaked liquid in through their pores. Naturally, they would prefer to be drunk, instead of to drink.""

Casker tried to dodge around the liquid, but it cut him off with a merry gurgle. Desperately, he picked up a small bale and threw it at the Voozy. The Voozy caught the bale and drank it. Then it discarded that and turned back to Casker.

Hellman tossed another box. The Voozy drank this one and a third and fourth that Casker threw in. Then, apparently exhausted, it flowed back into its vat.

Casker clapped down the lid and sat on it, trembling violently.

""Not so good,"" Hellman said. ""We've been taking it for granted that the Helgans had eating habits like us. But, of course, it doesn't necessarily—""

""No, it doesn't. No, sir, it certainly doesn't. I guess we can see that it doesn't. Anyone can see that it doesn't—""

""Stop that,"" Hellman ordered sternly. ""We've no time for hysteria.""

""Sorry."" Casker slowly moved away from the Voozy vat.

""I guess we'll have to assume that their meat is our poison,"" Hellman said thoughtfully. ""So now we'll see if their poison is our meat.""

Casker didn't say anything. He was wondering what would have happened if the Voozy had drunk him.

In the corner, the rubbery block was still giggling to itself.

""Now here's a likely-looking poison,"" Hellman said, half an hour later.

Casker had recovered completely, except for an occasional twitch of the lips.

""What does it say?"" he asked.

Hellman rolled a tiny tube in the palm of his hand. ""It's called Pvastkin's Plugger. The label reads: WARNING! HIGHLY DANGEROUS! PVASTKIN'S PLUGGER IS DESIGNED TO FILL HOLES OR CRACKS OF NOT MORE THAN TWO CUBIC VIMS. HOWEVER—THE PLUGGER IS NOT TO BE EATEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT, RAMOTOL, WHICH MAKES PVASTKIN'S SO EXCELLENT A PLUGGER RENDERS IT HIGHLY DANGEROUS WHEN TAKEN INTERNALLY.""

""Sounds great,"" Casker said. ""It'll probably blow us sky-high.""

""Do you have any other suggestions?"" Hellman asked.

Casker thought for a moment. The food of Helg was obviously unpalatable for humans. So perhaps was their poison ... but wasn't starvation better than this sort of thing?

After a moment's communion with his stomach, he decided that starvation was not better.

""Go ahead,"" he said.

Hellman slipped the burner under his arm and unscrewed the top of the little bottle. He shook it.

Nothing happened.

""It's got a seal,"" Casker pointed out.

Hellman punctured the seal with his fingernail and set the bottle on the floor. An evil-smelling green froth began to bubble out.

Hellman looked dubiously at the froth. It was congealing into a glob and spreading over the floor.

""Yeast, perhaps,"" he said, gripping the burner tightly.

""Come, come. Faint heart never filled an empty stomach.""

""I'm not holding you back,"" Hellman said.

The glob swelled to the size of a man's head.

""How long is that supposed to go on?"" Casker asked.

""Well,"" Hellman said, ""it's advertised as a Plugger. I suppose that's what it does—expands to plug up holes.""

""Sure. But how much?""

""Unfortunately, I don't know how much two cubic vims are. But it can't go on much—""

Belatedly, they noticed that the Plugger had filled almost a quarter of the room and was showing no signs of stopping.

""We should have believed the label!"" Casker yelled to him, across the spreading glob. ""It is dangerous!""

As the Plugger produced more surface, it began to accelerate in its growth. A sticky edge touched Hellman, and he jumped back.

""Watch out!""

He couldn't reach Casker on the other side of the gigantic sphere of blob. Hellman tried to run around, but the Plugger had spread, cutting the room in half. It began to swell toward the walls.

""Run for it!"" Hellman yelled, and rushed to the door behind him.

He flung it open just as the expanding glob reached him. On the other side of the room, he heard a door slam shut. Hellman didn't wait any longer. He sprinted through and slammed the door behind him.

He stood for a moment, panting, the burner in his hand. He hadn't realized how weak he was. That sprint had cut his reserves of energy dangerously close to the collapsing point. At least Casker had made it, too, though.

But he was still in trouble.

The Plugger poured merrily through the blasted lock, into the room. Hellman tried a practice shot on it, but the Plugger was evidently impervious ... as, he realized, a good plugger should be.

It was showing no signs of fatigue.

Hellman hurried to the far wall. The door was locked, as the others had been, so he burned out the lock and went through.

How far could the glob expand? How much was two cubic vims? Two cubic miles, perhaps? For all he knew, the Plugger was used to repair faults in the crusts of planets.

In the next room, Hellman stopped to catch his breath. He remembered that the building was circular. He would burn his way through the remaining doors and join Casker. They would burn their way outside and....

Casker didn't have a burner!

Hellman turned white with shock. Casker had made it into the room on the right, because they had burned it open earlier. The Plugger was undoubtedly oozing into that room through the shattered lock ... and Casker couldn't get out! The Plugger was on his left, a locked door on his right!

Rallying his remaining strength, Hellman began to run. Boxes seemed to get in his way purposefully, tripping him, slowing him down. He blasted the next door and hurried on to the next. And the next. And the next.

The Plugger couldn't expand completely into Casker's room!

Or could it?

The wedge-shaped rooms, each a segment of a circle, seemed to stretch before him forever, a jumbled montage of locked doors, alien goods, more doors, more goods. Hellman fell over a crate, got to his feet, and fell again. He had reached the limit of his strength, and passed it. But Casker was his friend.

Besides, without a pilot, he'd never get off the place.

Hellman struggled through two more rooms on trembling legs and then collapsed in front of a third.

""Is that you, Hellman?"" he heard Casker ask, from the other side of the door.

""You all right?"" Hellman managed to gasp.

""Haven't much room in here,"" Casker said, ""but the Plugger's stopped growing. Hellman, get me out of here!""

Hellman lay on the floor panting. ""Moment,"" he said.

""Moment, hell!"" Casker shouted. ""Get me out. I've found water!""

""What? How?""

""Get me out of here!""

Hellman tried to stand up, but his legs weren't cooperating. ""What happened?"" he asked.

""When I saw that glob filling the room, I figured I'd try to start up the Super Custom Transport. Thought maybe it could knock down the door and get me out. So I pumped it full of high-gain Integor fuel.""

""Yes?"" Hellman said, still trying to get his legs under control.

""That Super Custom Transport is an animal, Hellman! And the Integor fuel is water! Now get me out!""

Hellman lay back with a contented sigh. If he had had a little more time, he would have worked out the whole thing himself, by pure logic. But it was all very apparent now. The most efficient machine to go over those vertical, razor-sharp mountains would be an animal, probably with retractable suckers. It was kept in hibernation between trips; and if it drank water, the other products designed for it would be palatable, too. Of course, they still didn't know much about the late inhabitants, but undoubtedly....

""Burn down that door!"" Casker shrieked, his voice breaking.

Hellman was pondering the irony of it all. If one man's meat—and his poison—are your poison, then try eating something else. So simple, really.

But there was one thing that still bothered him.

""How did you know it was an Earth-type animal?"" he asked.

""Its breath, stupid! It inhales and exhales and smells as if it's eaten onions!"" There was a sound of cans falling and bottles shattering. ""Now hurry!""

""What's wrong?"" Hellman asked, finally getting to his feet and poising the burner.

""The Custom Super Transport. It's got me cornered behind a pile of cases. Hellman, it seems to think that I'm its meat!""

Broiled with the burner—well done for Hellman, medium rare for Casker—it was their meat, with enough left over for the trip back to Calao.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around survival and the struggle to find food in an alien environment. Hellman and Casker, stranded on a desolate planet after running out of provisions on their spaceship, face the immediate threat of starvation. Their dilemma is complicated by their limited understanding of the alien world they have landed on and their inability to determine what is edible among the unfamiliar alien goods they find in a warehouse.

The narrative explores themes of desperation, resourcefulness, and the limits of human knowledge when confronting the unknown. The protagonists must navigate their lack of expertise in alien biology and chemistry to discern what might sustain them, all while dealing with the psychological stress of their dire situation.

012.txt,"There was once a child who liked to walk around a lot and think about many things. He had a sister who was a child too, and they were always together. These two would wonder all day long. They were amazed by the beauty of flowers, the height and blueness of the sky, the depth of the shining water, and the goodness and power of God, who made the lovely world.

Sometimes they would say to each other, ""What if all the children on earth died? Would the flowers, water, and sky be sad?"" They believed they would be sad because they thought the buds were the children of the flowers, the little playful streams were the children of the water, and the smallest bright specks in the sky at night were the children of the stars. They thought all these things would be sad if their playmates, the children of people, were gone.

There was one clear, shining star that would come out in the sky before the others, near the church tower, above the graves. It seemed larger and more beautiful than all the others, and every night they watched for it, standing hand in hand at a window. Whoever saw it first would cry out, ""I see the star!"" Often, they would both cry out together, knowing so well when and where it would rise. They became such good friends with it that before going to bed, they always looked out once more to say good night; and as they turned to sleep, they would say, ""God bless the star!""

But while she was still very young, the sister became weak and could no longer stand at the window at night. Then the child looked out sadly by himself, and when he saw the star, he would turn to the pale face on the bed and say, ""I see the star!"" A smile would come to her face, and in a little weak voice, she would say, ""God bless my brother and the star!""

And so the time came, too soon, when the child looked out alone, and there was no face on the bed. There was a new little grave among the graves, and the star made long rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears.

These rays were so bright, and they seemed to make a shining path from earth to heaven. When the child went to bed, he dreamed about the star. He dreamed that, lying where he was, he saw a line of people being taken up that sparkling road by angels. The star opened and showed him a great world of light where many more angels waited to meet them.

All these angels, who were waiting, turned their bright eyes on the people being brought into the star. Some came out from the rows where they stood, hugged the people, and walked away with them down paths of light, so happy to be with them, that the child cried tears of joy in his bed.

But there were many angels who did not go with them, and among them was one he knew. The pale face that had once been on the bed was now glowing and radiant, but his heart recognized his sister among the crowd.

His sister’s angel stayed near the entrance of the star and asked the leader of those bringing the people, ""Is my brother here?""

And he said, ""No.""

She was turning away hopefully when the child reached out his arms and cried, ""O sister, I am here! Take me!"" Then she turned her bright eyes on him, and it was night; the star was shining into the room, making long rays down towards him through his tears.

From that moment on, the child looked at the star as the home he would go to when it was his time. He felt that he belonged not only to the earth but also to the star because his sister’s angel had gone before him.

There was a baby born to be his brother; and while he was still so little that he had never spoken a word, he stretched out on his bed and died.

Again, the child dreamed of the opened star, the company of angels, the line of people, and the rows of angels with their bright eyes on the people's faces.

His sister’s angel asked the leader, ""Is my brother here?""

And he said, ""Not that one, but another.""

As the child saw his brother’s angel in her arms, he cried, ""O sister, I am here! Take me!"" She turned and smiled at him, and the star was shining.

He grew to be a young man and was busy with his studies when an old servant came to him and said, ""Your mother is no more. I bring her blessing on her darling son!""

Again at night, he saw the star and all the familiar company. His sister’s angel asked the leader, ""Is my brother here?""

And he said, ""Your mother!""

A great cry of joy came from all the star because the mother was reunited with her two children. He stretched out his arms and cried, ""O mother, sister, and brother, I am here! Take me!""

And they answered him, ""Not yet."" And the star was shining.

He grew to be a man with gray hair. He was sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy with sadness and tears on his face, when the star opened once again.

His sister’s angel asked the leader, ""Is my brother here?""

And he said, ""No, but his young daughter.""

The man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a heavenly creature among those three, and he said, ""My daughter’s head is on my sister’s chest, her arm is around my mother’s neck, and at her feet is the baby from long ago, and I can bear the parting from her, thank God!""

And the star was shining.

The child grew old, his once smooth face was wrinkled, his steps slow and weak, his back bent. One night, as he lay on his bed, his children standing around, he cried, as he had long ago, ""I see the star!""

They whispered to each other, ""He is dying.""

And he said, ""I am. My age is falling from me like a garment, and I move towards the star as a child. O my Father, I thank you that it has so often opened to receive those dear ones who are waiting for me!""

And the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around the child's grappling with loss, longing, and the passage of time. Initially, the child experiences the joy and wonder of life alongside his sister, sharing a deep connection with nature and the star they watch together. However, as the story progresses, he faces the sorrow of losing his sister, and subsequently other family members, which introduces him to the concept of mortality and the inevitable separation from loved ones.

Despite these losses, the child's recurring dreams of the star and the vision of angels welcoming his family members provide a comforting resolution to his grief. The star symbolizes a place of reunion and eternal connection, offering solace and hope that he will one day join them. Throughout his life, he learns to accept the departures of those he loves, finding peace in the belief that they are together in a better place, waiting for him.

Ultimately, the story explores the tension between the pain of loss and the hope of spiritual reunion, as well as the transformation of the child's understanding of life and death. This internal journey from sorrow to acceptance and anticipation of reunion resolves the central conflict, culminating in the child's own peaceful transition towards the star.","If a star could reunite you with your lost family, would you spend your life looking up, waiting to join them?","How would you cope with losing so much, yet seeing hope in a shining star guiding you to a reunion?",Imagine being a child seeing your sister in a star.

013.txt,"Nobody was surprised when Martin's mom disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Moms often disappeared in their neighborhood, and the kids usually ended up better off without them. Martin was no different. Living with his mom had never been this good. As for his dad, Martin never had one. He was born during a war when soldiers, both friends and foes, would take or buy women as they moved through the country. So, no dad problems for Martin.

Sometimes, Martin wondered who Ninian really was. Her story about coming from the future seemed like a joke. Besides, if she was really his great-great-granddaughter, why did she ask him to call her ""Aunt Ninian""? Even though he was only eleven, Martin knew what was going on. At first, he thought she might be a new kind of social worker, but she acted too weird for that.

He loved teasing her, just like he loved teasing his mom. It was safer with Ninian because when he went too far, she would cry instead of hitting him.

""But I don't get it,"" he would say, keeping a straight face. ""Why do you have to come from the future to protect me from your cousin Conrad?""

""Because he's coming to kill you.""

""Why should he kill me? I haven't done anything to him.""

Ninian sighed. ""He's unhappy with the way things are, and killing you is part of his plan to change it. You wouldn't understand.""

""You're right. I don't understand. What's it all about?""

""Oh, just don't ask any questions,"" Ninian said, annoyed. ""When you get older, someone will explain it to you.""

So Martin didn't ask more because he liked how things were. Ninian was really something else, though. Everyone he knew lived in old, crummy apartments like his, but she thought it was gross.

""If you don't like it, clean it up,"" he suggested.

She looked at him like he was crazy.

""Then hire a maid!"" he teased.

And wouldn't you know it, Ninian actually got someone to clean the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even want to show his face outside—especially with the women in the neighborhood asking what was going on. They tried talking to Ninian, but she was good at ignoring them.

One day, the truant officer came by to ask why Martin hadn't been going to school. Most kids in the neighborhood didn't go regularly, so it was no big deal. But Ninian didn't know that and got all flustered, saying Martin had been sick and would catch up on his work. Martin almost got sick from laughing so much inside.

But he didn't laugh when she got him a private tutor. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin had to fight with every kid on the block before they stopped calling him ""Fancy Pants.""

Ninian worried a lot. It wasn't that she cared what people thought of her; she made it clear she thought they were not much better than animals. But she didn't want to attract attention. A lot of people in the neighborhood felt the same, but she didn't know that either. Martin thought she was pretty clueless despite her fancy talk.

""It's hard to figure this stuff out without any real experience,"" she told him.

He nodded, knowing she meant everything was going wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what she'd do next. He was already starting to just watch things happen.

When it was clear his mom wasn't coming back, Ninian bought a small, identical house like the ones that popped up after wars, especially where bombing had made room for new buildings.

""This is a better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,"" she said. ""Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.""

And keep an eye on him she did—she or a fancy young man who sometimes stayed with them. Martin was told to call him Uncle Raymond.

From time to time, other visitors came—Uncles Ives, Bartholomew, Olaf, Aunts Ottillie, Grania, Lalage, and many more—all related, he was told, all his future family.

Martin was never left alone. He wasn't allowed to play with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents would have let them anyway. The adults figured that if a family with one car hired tutors for their kid, something must be wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian stood out just as much as before. But he didn't tell her. She was an adult; she should have known better.

He lived well. He had food he'd never dreamed of, warm clothes no one had worn before him. He was surrounded by more luxury than he knew what to do with.

The furniture was the latest style. There were nice prints on the walls. And every inch of the floor was covered with carpet, though the walls were mostly glass. There was hot water and heat all the time and a freezer full of food—though Ninian wasn't great at planning meals.

The non-glass parts of the house were neat, with a green lawn in front and a colorful garden in back.

Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other kids to play with. He even missed his mom. Sure, she hadn't fed him much and sometimes hit him really hard—but there had also been times when she hugged and kissed him, crying on his shoulder. She did her best for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if respectable society didn't like it, too bad.

From Ninian and her family, there was only impersonal kindness. They made it clear they were there only to do a duty. Though they were with him, their minds and talk were in another world—a world of warmth, peace, and plenty where nobody worked, except in government or essential jobs. And they thought even those jobs were pretty low-class.

In their world, Martin realized, nobody worked with their hands; machines did everything. People just wore nice clothes, had fun, and ate all they wanted. There was no war, no unhappiness, none of the usual problems of life.

Martin started to see that either they were all crazy, or Ninian's story was true—they came from the future.

When Martin was sixteen, Raymond explained things to him.

""It's all because of my brother Conrad. You see, he's an idealist,"" Raymond said, as if the word tasted bad.

Martin nodded seriously. He was a quiet boy now, and his past seemed far away. Who could imagine him robbing a store now? He was still small, and his eyesight was weak from reading too much, so he wore glasses. His face was pale because he didn't go out much, and his speech was polished because his future family had taught him to avoid all slang.

""And Conrad got upset about how Earth treats less intelligent life-forms on other planets,"" Raymond continued. ""It's upsetting—but it's not like they're people. Besides, the government is talking about laws to fix things, and I'm sure it will work out. But Conrad is impatient.""

""I thought in your world, machines did all the work,"" Martin said.

""I've told you—our world is the same as this one!"" Raymond snapped. ""We just come a couple of centuries later. But remember, our interests are the same. We're practically the same people... although it's amazing what a difference a couple of hundred years makes.""

He continued more calmly: ""But you can understand that we can't make machines without metal. We need food. All that comes from the outer planets. And there, it's cheaper to use local workers than to ship machinery. If we didn't give them jobs, how would they live?""

""How did they live before? And if you don't work, how do you live now?"" Martin asked, trying to understand.

""I'm trying to treat you like an adult,"" Raymond said, ""but if you keep interrupting—""

""I'm sorry,"" Martin said.

But he wasn't, because he had little respect for his descendants. They were all good-looking, educated, and confident, but not very bright. And Raymond was the smartest of them. Somewhere in time, his line—or maybe his race—had lost something important.

Raymond didn't know Martin looked down on him. He went on: ""Anyhow, Conrad felt guilty because he thought our great-grandfather's discovery of the space-drive led to all this. It's silly—feeling guilty, I mean. Maybe a great-grandfather is responsible for his great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can't be blamed for his great-grandfather.""

""How about a great-great-grandchild?"" Martin asked.

Raymond blushed. ""Do you want to hear the rest of this or not?""

""Oh, I do!"" Martin said. He had figured it out himself long ago, but he wanted to hear Raymond's version.

""Unfortunately, Professor Farkas just invented the time transmitter. Those government scientists are so annoying—always inventing useless things. It's supposed to be secret, but news leaks out when people need something to talk about.""

Raymond explained that Conrad got a copy of the plans. Conrad wanted to go back in time and ""eliminate"" their great-grandfather. That way, there would be no space-drive, and the Earth wouldn't reach other planets and mistreat the locals.

""Sounds like a good way to solve the problem,"" Martin said.

Raymond looked annoyed. ""It's the teenage way,"" he said, ""to get rid of it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole society to fix one problem?""

""Not if it was good otherwise.""

""Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the machine built, or maybe he built it himself. One doesn't ask too much about these things. But when it came to it, Conrad couldn't eliminate our great-grandfather—because he was a good man, you know."" Raymond's lip curled. ""So Conrad decided to go further back and get rid of his great-grandfather's father—who was, by all accounts, not a nice person.""

""That would be me,"" Martin said quietly.

Raymond turned pink. ""Well, doesn't that just go to show you can't believe everything you hear?"" Then he rushed on: ""I found out everything, and the rest of us had a meeting, and we decided it was our duty to go back in time and protect you."" He smiled at Martin.

Martin smiled back. ""Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in getting rid of me, then none of you would exist, would you?""

Raymond frowned, then shrugged. ""Well, you didn't really think we were doing all this out of kindness, did you?"" he asked, using the charm all the cousins had.

Martin knew nobody did anything for nothing. But he didn't say so.

""We got another set of plans from another assistant,"" Raymond continued, ""and got someone to build the gadget for us.""

Martin knew ""got"" could mean anything from bribery to threats.

""Then we were ready to stop Conrad. If one of us watched you day and night, he wouldn't succeed. So we made our plan, set the machine to go back as far as it would go—and here we are!""

""I see,"" Martin said.

Raymond didn't think he did. ""After all,"" he said, ""whatever our reasons, it's turned out well for you. Nice home, cultured company, all the modern conveniences, plus some extras—I don't see what more you could ask for. You're getting the best of both worlds. Of course, Ninian was silly to choose a suburb where anything unusual would cause talk. I'm so glad our time has done away with suburbs—""

""What did you do with them?"" Martin asked.

But Raymond rushed on: ""As soon as Ninian leaves and I'm in charge, we'll get a more isolated place and live on a grander scale. Show off—that's the way to live here; the richer you are, the more you can get away with. And,"" he added, ""I might as well be comfortable while I'm stuck in this boring historical assignment.""

""So Ninian's leaving,"" Martin said, surprised that he felt a little sad. Because, although he liked her in a distant way, he knew they weren't close.

""Well, five years is a long time for any girl to spend away from home,"" Raymond explained, ""even though our lives are longer than yours. Besides, you're too old for a woman's care."" He looked at Martin. ""You're not going to cry and make a scene when she leaves, are you?""

""No..."" Martin said slowly. ""Oh, I guess I'll miss her. But we're not close, so it won't really matter."" That was the sad part: he knew it wouldn't matter.

Raymond patted him on the shoulder. ""I knew you weren't a silly softie like Conrad. Though you do look a bit like him.""

Suddenly, Conrad seemed real. Martin felt a little worried. He kept his voice calm. ""How do you plan to protect me when he comes?""

""Well, we're all armed, of course,"" Raymond said proudly, showing a toy-like gun that Martin had no doubt was real—and dangerous. ""And we've got a fancy alarm system.""

Martin looked at the system and made a few changes to make it better. But he was still unsure. ""Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house, but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time?""

""Don't worry—it works through time,"" Raymond replied. ""Factory guarantee and all that.""

""Just to be safe,"" Martin said, ""I think I'd better have one of those guns, too.""

""Great idea!"" Raymond said. ""I was just about to think of that myself!""

When it was time to say goodbye, it was Ninian who cried—tears of frustration, Martin knew, not sadness. He was getting good at reading his descendants, better than they were at understanding him. But then they didn't really try. Ninian kissed him on the cheek and said she was sure everything would be fine and that she'd visit him again. She never did, except at the very end.

Raymond and Martin moved into a fancy mansion in a remote area. The place proved to be a good choice; when the Second Atomic War came six years later, they weren't hit. Martin was never sure whether this was luck or planning. Probably luck, because his descendants weren't great planners.

Few people could live as grandly as Martin and his guardian. The place had every possible convenience and was filled with decorations and antiques, carefully chosen by Raymond and argued over by Martin, because to someone from the future, all available things were antiques. Otherwise, Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder was gone, and the pink castle impressed him far less than the suburban house had.

""How about a moat?"" Martin suggested when they first arrived. ""It seems to fit with a castle.""

""Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?"" Raymond asked, amused.

""No,"" Martin smiled, feeling silly, ""but it would make the place seem safer somehow.""

The threat of Conrad was making him more nervous. He got Raymond's permission to give two suits of armor in the foyer to a museum because he thought he saw them move. He also got good with the ray gun and changed the landscape around them until Raymond warned that it might attract Conrad.

During those early years, Martin's tutors were replaced with more advanced ones. The question of what Martin would do with his life came up. At least twenty cousins came back through time to have a family meeting. Martin was still young enough to enjoy these occasions; they were better than any other entertainment.

""This wouldn't be a problem in our time,"" Raymond said as he took his place at the head of the table, ""because, unless someone feels a calling, they just drift along happily.""

""Ours is a wonderful world,"" Grania sighed. ""I wish we could take you there. I'm sure you'd like it.""

""Don't be silly, Grania!"" Raymond snapped. ""Well, Martin, have you decided what you want to be?""

Martin pretended to think. ""A physicist,"" he said with a hint of mischief. ""Or maybe an engineer.""

There was a loud chorus of disagreement. He chuckled to himself.

""You can't do that,"" Ives said. ""You might learn things from us. We don't know how, but it could happen. Subconscious learning, if that's a thing. You might invent something early. And the person we got the plans from warned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.""

""Could mess up our time badly,"" Bartholomew said, ""though I don't understand how.""

""I'm not explaining it again, Bart!"" Raymond said impatiently. ""Well, Martin?""

""What would you suggest?"" Martin asked.

""How about becoming a painter? Art is timeless. And quite respectable. Besides, artists can be ahead of their time.""

""Also,"" Ottillie added, ""one more artist wouldn't change history much. There have been so many artists.""

Martin couldn't help asking, ""What was I, actually, in that other time?""

There was an awkward silence.

""Let's not talk about it,"" Lalage finally said. ""Let's just be thankful we've saved you from that!""

So drawing teachers were hired, and Martin became a very good second-rate artist. He knew he'd never be great because, even though he was young, his work was mostly intellectual. The only feeling he seemed to have was fear—the constant fear that he'd meet someone who looked like him and wanted to kill him for an ideal.

But the fear didn't show in Martin's paintings. They were pleasant pictures.

Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants ""cousin""—took over as his guardian. Ives was more serious about his job. He even arranged for Martin's work to be shown in a gallery. The paintings got good reviews but didn't excite anyone. They sold a little, mostly to decorators. Museums weren't interested.

""It takes time,"" Ives said to reassure him. ""One day they'll be buying your pictures. Wait and see.""

Ives was the only descendant who seemed to see Martin as a person. When he couldn't connect with him, Ives got worried and decided Martin needed a change of scenery.

""Of course, you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented space travel yet. But we can see this world. What's left of it. Tourists like ruins best, anyway.""

So he used the family's future resources and bought a yacht, which Martin named ""The Interregnum."" They traveled from sea to sea and ocean to ocean, visiting ports and going inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in parts; the nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the same as it had been for ages. It was like visiting a huge museum; he couldn't connect with his time anymore.

The other cousins liked the yacht because they could stay away from the modern people and relax. So they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on ""The Interregnum."" He felt safer from Conrad there, although there was no real reason why an ocean should stop a time traveler.

More cousins came at once because they liked the sea trip. They spent most of their time on the ship, having parties and playing shuffleboard and betting on future sports events. That usually ended in a fight because someone would accuse another of having inside knowledge.

Martin didn't care much for their company and spent time with them only when not doing so would be rude. And, though they were friendly people, they didn't seek his company. He suspected he made them uncomfortable.

He liked Ives, though. Sometimes they were alone together, and Ives would tell Martin about the future world. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian wasn't completely accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth, but that was because there were only a few million people left. It was a special place for the privileged, to which Martin's descendants belonged because of their famous ancestor.

""Pretty feudal, isn't it?"" Martin asked.

Ives agreed, adding that the system was planned, not a natural development. Everything bad, like big business, had been sent away.

""Not just natives on other worlds,"" Ives said as they stood at the rail, surrounded by the endless sea. ""People too. Mostly lower classes, except for officials. With wars and suffering,"" he added sadly, ""just like your time... Like now, I mean,"" he corrected himself. ""Maybe it is worse, like Conrad thinks. More planets for us to mess up. Three that were livable aren't anymore. Bombed. Very thorough job.""

""Oh,"" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested, even.

""Sometimes I'm not sure Conrad was wrong,"" Ives said after a pause. ""Tried to stop us from reaching the stars, hurting the people—if you can call them that—there. Still,"" he smiled shyly, ""couldn't stand by and see my way of life destroyed, could I?""

""I suppose not,"" Martin said.

""Would take courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except Conrad, and even he—"" Ives looked out to sea. ""Must be a better way than Conrad's,"" he said without hope. ""And everything will work out in the end. Has to. No sense to anything if it doesn't."" He looked hopefully at Martin.

""I hope so,"" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he couldn't even care.

During all this time, Conrad still didn’t show up. Martin became such a good shot with the ray gun that he almost wished his descendant would appear, just for some excitement. But he didn’t come. And Martin got to thinking...

He always felt that if any of the cousins could realize the flaw in their plan, it would be Ives. However, when the yacht reached Tierra del Fuego in winter, Ives caught a chill. They called a doctor from the future—a cousin who had become a doctor—but he couldn't save Ives. His body was buried in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the continent, over a century before his birth.

Many cousins attended the simple ceremony. All wore black and seemed very sad. Raymond read the service because they didn’t dare call a future priest; they feared he might disapprove of the whole affair.

“He died for all of us,” Raymond finished his eulogy for Ives, “so his death was not in vain.”

But Martin disagreed.

The endless journey continued. ""The Interregnum"" sailed to every ocean and sea. Some were blue, some green, some brown. After a while, Martin couldn’t tell one from another. Cousin after cousin came to watch over him, and eventually, they were as hard for him to tell apart as the different oceans.

All the cousins were young because, though they came at different times in his life, they all started from the same time in theirs. Only the young ones were included in the venture; they didn’t trust their elders.

As the years passed, Martin lost interest in the land and its happenings. Although the yacht often stopped for fuel or supplies—it was cheaper to buy them in that time than have them shipped from the future—he rarely went ashore, and only when a new cousin urged him to see the sights. Most of the time, Martin watched the sea—and sometimes painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes that his other work lacked.

When pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit, he decided to show a few of his sea paintings. That way, he could pretend there was some purpose to this journey. He’d come to believe that what his life lacked was purpose, and for a while, he looked for meaning everywhere, to the cousin’s disgust.

“Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you do,” the cousin—who was not great at history; they were scraping the bottom now—advised.

Martin showed his work in Italy, so the cousin could be disappointed by the modern Romans. He found that neither purpose nor malice was enough; he was still terribly bored. However, a museum bought two paintings. Martin thought of Ives and felt a strange feeling he could no longer understand.

“Where do you think Conrad has been all this time?” Martin idly asked the current cousin—who was now pretending to be his nephew.

The young man jumped, then looked around nervously. “Conrad’s very clever,” he whispered. “He’s waiting for the right moment—when we’re not ready. And then—pow!—he’ll attack!”

“Oh, I see,” Martin said.

He had often thought Conrad would be the most interesting member of the generation. But it seemed unlikely he would ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one conversation, anyway.

“When he does show up, I’ll protect you,” the cousin vowed, touching his ray gun. “You’ve got nothing to worry about.”

Martin smiled with all the charm he’d had time to develop. “I have every confidence in you,” he told his descendant. He had given up carrying a gun long ago.

There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere, so ""The Interregnum"" sailed south. There was a war in the south, and they hid in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel, men, and will—to fight, so there was a tense peace for a long time. ""The Interregnum"" roamed the seas with her passengers from the future and one bored old contemporary. She had big guns now, because of the danger of pirates.

Perhaps it was the sea air—perhaps the sheltered life—but Martin lived to be very old. He was a hundred and four when his last illness came. It was a relief when the family doctor, called again from the future, said there was no hope. Martin didn’t think he could bear another year of life.

All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to their ancestor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and Raymond—all the others, dozens of them, crowding around his bed, spilling into the passageways and out onto the deck, making their usual noise, even though their voices were hushed.

Only Ives was missing. He’d been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had been spared the fate that was going to befall these young people—all the same age as when Martin last saw them and doomed never to grow older. Beneath their sad masks, he saw relief that they were finally going to be free of their responsibility. And beneath Martin’s death mask lay an impersonal pity for those poor, foolish descendants of his who had blundered so completely.

There was one face Martin had never seen before. It wasn’t strange, though, because Martin had seen one like it in the mirror when he was young.

“You must be Conrad,” Martin called across the cabin in a clear voice. “I’ve been looking forward to meeting you for some time.”

The other cousins turned to face the newcomer.

“You’re too late, Con,” Raymond gloated for the whole generation. “He’s lived out his life.”

“But he hasn’t lived out his life,” Conrad contradicted. “He’s lived out the life you created for him. And for yourselves, too.”

For the first time, Martin saw compassion in one of his lineage’s eyes and found it unsettling. It didn’t seem to belong there.

“Don’t you realize even yet,” Conrad said, “that as soon as he goes, you’ll go, too—present, past, future, wherever you are, you’ll vanish like smoke?”

“What do you mean?” Ninian quavered, her pretty face worried.

Martin returned Conrad’s smile but left the explanations to him. It was his show, after all.

“Because you will never have existed,” Conrad said. “You have no right to exist; it was you who watched him all the time, so he didn’t have a chance to live a normal life, get married, have children....”

Most of the cousins gasped as the truth sank in.

“I knew from the start,” Conrad finished, “that I didn’t have to do anything. I just had to wait, and you would destroy yourselves.”

“I don’t understand,” Bartholomew protested, looking around at the other cousins. “What does he mean, we have never existed? We’re here, aren’t we? What—”

“Shut up!” Raymond snapped. He turned to Martin. “You don’t seem surprised.”

The old man grinned. “I’m not. I figured it out years ago.”

At first, he wondered what to do. Should he throw them into a panic by telling them or do nothing? He decided on the latter; that was the role they had given him—to watch and wait and keep out of things—and that was the role he would play.

“You knew all the time and didn’t tell us!” Raymond spluttered. “After we were so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead of a criminal.... That’s right,” he snarled, “a criminal! An alcoholic, a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?”

“Sounds like a rich, full life,” Martin said wistfully.

What an exciting life they must have deprived him of! But then, he couldn’t help thinking, he—and Conrad—had deprived them of any kind of existence. It wasn’t his responsibility, though; he had done nothing but let things take their destined course. If only he could be sure it was the better course, he might not feel that guilt inside him. Strange—where, in his closed life, could he have developed such a thing as a conscience?

“Then we’ve wasted all this time,” Ninian sobbed, “all this energy, all this money, for nothing!”

“But you were nothing to begin with,” Martin told them. And then, after a pause, he added, “I only wish I could be sure there was some purpose to this.”

He didn’t know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight, or whether the frightened crowd around him was growing shadowy.

“I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you be erased from existence,” he continued. “But I know that the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world will happen again. To other people, in other times, but again. It’s bound to happen. There isn’t any hope for humanity.”

One man couldn’t really change the course of human history, he told himself. Two men, that was—one real, one a shadow.

Conrad came close to the old man’s bed. He was almost see-through.

“No,” he said, “there is hope. They didn’t know the time transmitter works both ways. I used it to go into the past only once—just this once. But I’ve gone into the future with it many times. And—” he pressed Martin’s hand—“believe me, what I did—what we did, you and I—serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everything is going to be all right.”

Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just comforting the dying? More than that, was he trying to convince himself that what he had done was right? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all right.

Was Conrad really different from the rest?

His plan had worked, and the others’ hadn’t, but then all his plan had been was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ... nothing. Were they free of responsibility just because they had stood aside and taken advantage of the others’ weaknesses?

“Why,” Martin said to himself, “in a sense, it could be said that I have fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal.”

Well, it didn’t matter; whatever happened, no one could blame him. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other men’s future—other men’s problem. He died very peacefully then, and, since he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury him.

015.txt,"The Triomed moved quietly across the floor of the dark cell toward the sleeping person in the corner. After a long, lonely journey, the Triomed was eager to find a host.

The small spaceship that brought him to this lush planet was hidden well. He believed his arrival went unnoticed, which was important since he was a Triomed and a scientist. His race was dying, but this new planet with its many warm-blooded creatures could change that.

The sleeping person moved restlessly, sensing danger. The Triomed stayed still. He knew he couldn’t be seen, even though sight wasn’t one of his natural senses. But he had learned that almost every creature on this planet used sight to understand their world.

He had worried that native viruses might be like the ones from his home, but they turned out to be primitive and not a threat. The biped he chose as a host relaxed again, and the Triomed continued to move towards it, a flat, shiny smear on the floor.

From high above the planet, the Triomed had sensed the city. He understood its shape and size as his spaceship descended through the atmosphere. It wasn't enough to know there were suitable hosts; he needed proof. Being without a host for so long made him crave the connection and control over a warm-blooded creature.

He had landed in a quiet part of the city, hidden in the trees. He sensed many creatures nearby. There were insects, plants, and warm-blooded animals. He moved through the darkness until he found a sleeping creature, ready to take control.

The shiny shape turned into a thin strand and touched the sleeper’s skin, bringing pleasure to the Triomed. Carefully, he moved up the sleeper's leg and into the nostril, finally reaching the area behind the eye, where he found the pineal gland.

Once inside, the Triomed took control easily. The host's mind was young and simple, and it quickly stopped resisting. New sensations flooded in from the host’s senses—sounds, smells, sights. All these were new data for the Triomed.

Now, in control of the host, he could explore further. He stayed still for a while, getting used to the host’s body. It had arms with fingers and legs to support its weight. Inside, there were familiar organs like lungs and a stomach. The host was healthy, which pleased the Triomed.

After some practice, the Triomed stood up. He didn’t know how to leave the cell, but he decided to use the host’s strength to bend the bars covering the window. He was right; the host was strong enough.

After escaping, he moved along a walkway lined with similar cells. Some creatures inside were awake, others asleep, but none sounded an alarm. He climbed a fence and found himself on wet grass leading to the woods.

A shout came from behind him, and a beam of light searched the darkness. He saw a small person running toward the cell he had left. The Triomed ran toward the woods, moving quickly and avoiding the light.

In the woods, he paused. The trees weren’t thick, and he could see the city lights. Vehicles moved fast on a nearby road. There was no effective pursuit, so he continued to the city’s edge.

Once there, he watched the traffic. The vehicles used engines burning fuel, which he thought was primitive. This was good news because, when his people arrived, there would be little resistance.

He waited for a gap in the traffic and crossed the road. A vehicle stopped suddenly, and its driver stared in shock at the Triomed. This unsettled him. Had he done something wrong? He realized he must be more careful to avoid drawing attention.

He moved through the city shadows, aware of the life around him. He needed to explore freely, without fear, to learn more.

He found a busy street filled with people. From a doorway, he watched them, amazed at the variety of hosts available. Enough for all his people. This was only one city among many. He imagined his people arriving and taking control.

Having learned enough, he decided to return to his ship. He needed to send a message home. His ship’s communicator could relay it once he was in space. He would return to the host afterward to wait for his people.

But as he stepped into the crowd, people screamed and ran away. He stood in shock as they scattered. He began to feel afraid.

The Triomed walked quickly, but the crowd parted fearfully. Some people threw things at him. He started to run. He noticed he was taller than most people, and the host’s mind sensed fear and anger around him.

He was being pursued. Sirens wailed, and vehicles flashed red lights. He felt pain in his leg and saw blood. Ahead, people in blue uniforms blocked his path. They held objects he believed were weapons.

Trapped, he jumped onto a building, clinging to its side. Someone inside poked at him with a burning rod. He climbed upward, despite his injuries.

Searchlights found him as he reached the roof. People with weapons were waiting. He backed up, afraid. A small person approached, holding a vial. The Triomed’s host recognized him from the cell. The person spoke softly, trying to calm him.

Feeling rage, the Triomed growled. The person’s fear was clear. As he came closer, the Triomed attacked.

Weapons fired. The Triomed felt impacts on the host’s head. He tried to escape from the host’s brain, knowing he would die if the host did. But a bullet hit the eye and moved inward, bringing pain. His last sensation was the searing touch of the bullet before darkness came.

The Triomed, a member of a dying race, arrives on a new planet in search of a host to inhabit, driven by the desperation to ensure the survival of his species. This creates a conflict between his need to use another living being for his purposes and the moral implications of such an action.

The Triomed's internal conflict is compounded by the external conflict with the human society he encounters. The humans react with fear and aggression when they become aware of the Triomed's presence, leading to a physical confrontation that ultimately results in the Triomed's demise.

The story explores themes of survival, invasion, and the consequences of overstepping ethical boundaries, highlighting the tension between the Triomed's scientific mission and the instinctive human response to perceived threats.

016.txt,"About twelve years ago, there was going to be an election in the Borough of N----. This place was known for bribery, and I knew it well, having worked on many elections there before. It used to be a bustling town with a unique trade, but when new factories needed to be built, the local government refused because they didn't want smoky chimneys. So, the industry moved just outside the town, and N---- started to decline. The town became a place of people with airs and pretension, as it was still a parliamentary borough, making it an attractive target for politicians with money and clever agents.

The town had different types of voters. One group was honest and wouldn't accept bribes. Another group leaned towards Conservatism and would take less money from a true supporter than from some new wealthy Radical. The last group didn't care about politics and just wanted as much money as they could get from anyone.

The agents who worked elections knew how to deal with this, but they always had to be careful. Sometimes, a wealthy political speculator would arrive with a lot of money just before the election, trying to win over voters with bribes. The local agents would be worried because they knew the largest amount of money usually won.

An interesting fact about N---- was that the brothel-keepers had a strong say in who got elected. When all the honest voters had been polled, the brothel-keepers would sell their votes to the highest bidder, often deciding the election outcome.

A cabinet minister had even been elected in N---- due to these brothel-keepers and his money. Seeing an opportunity, I got involved in an election campaign. My candidate, Mr. Jollefat, was a retired tallow-melter who wanted to enter Parliament. 

However, Mrs. Jollefat was unwilling to spend a lot of money on the campaign. My associate and I were determined to make them spend more and win the election.

I came up with a plan. I went to London and hired a man to pretend to be a third candidate. He was given a false name and made an impressive entrance into N---- with a heavy-looking box, creating the illusion he was carrying a lot of money for bribes.

The town was in an uproar when our fake candidate, Mr. Fipps, appeared. He quickly gained popularity, and a committee was formed to support him.

On the day of the election, Mr. Fipps made a grand speech, and many voters supported him. However, he disappeared before the polling, leaving the town in chaos. The box he left behind was opened by a curious crowd, only to find it filled with rocks instead of gold.

As a result, Mr. Jollefat was elected by the remaining honest voters, and Mr. Fipps's supporters were left with nothing.

The Jollefats were initially upset, but they ended up with a small campaign cost and a seat in Parliament. The fake candidate, Mr. Fipps, was paid off and left for America to avoid any trouble.

In the end, my great electioneering trick was a success, and I managed to keep the Jollefats' money safe while securing Mr. Jollefat's victory.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the corrupt electoral practices in the Borough of N----, where bribery and manipulation are rampant. The dilemma for the protagonist and his associate is how to secure an election victory for their candidate, Mr. Jollefat, without spending a substantial amount of money, as Mrs. Jollefat is unwilling to invest heavily in the campaign.

The protagonist devises a clever scheme to introduce a fake candidate, Mr. Fipps, to create the illusion of a well-funded opponent. This strategic deception aims to manipulate the expectations and actions of the voters and other political agents involved in the election. The uproar caused by Mr. Fipps's appearance and subsequent disappearance creates chaos, ultimately leading to Mr. Jollefat's election by the honest voters who remain.

017.txt,"The beings stood around my bed in air suits that looked like ski suits, with helmets over their heads that resembled upside-down fishbowls. It all felt like a costume party, with strange outfits and funny masks.

I know those masks are their real faces, but when I talk to them, I think of them as humans behind the masks. They are people. I can tell if I'm going to like someone by the way they move and get excited when they talk, and I feel a motherly affection towards them. It's something I can't help.

They remind me of Ronny, a medical student I once knew. He was small, round, and eager. You had to like him, though you couldn't take him too seriously. He was a pacifist who wrote poetry and would read it aloud at awkward times, and he stuttered when he spoke too quickly.

These beings seem like that too—nervous and gentle.

I'm not the only survivor—they've told me that—but I'm the first one they found and the least injured, so they've chosen me to represent humans to them. They stand around my bed, answering questions and being nice even when I argue with them.

Together, they look like a mix between a group of nations and a collection of animals: big and small, thick and thin, with four arms or wings, and all sorts of fur, skin, and feathers.

I can imagine them in their version of the United Nations, making speeches in their own languages, listening without really understanding each other's issues, boring each other and being too polite to yawn.

They are so polite that I almost feel like they're scared of me, and I want to comfort them.

But when I talk, it sounds like I'm angry. I can't help it, because if things had been just a little different... ""Why couldn't you have come sooner? Why couldn't you have tried to stop it before it happened, or at least come sooner, afterward...?""

If they had come sooner to where the workers at the Nevada power plant were slowly starving behind their protective lead walls—if they had looked for survivors of the dust that destroyed nations—George Craig might still be alive. He died before they arrived. He was my coworker, and I loved him.

We had gone underground together, passing through doors meant to protect the outside world from the radioactive danger inside—but the real danger was politics, not the power plant, and no one had planned for that. We were deep underground when the radioactivity outside triggered the heavy, lead-shielded doors to close, trapping us inside.

We were safe. But we starved there.

""Why didn't you come sooner?"" I wonder if they know how I feel. My questions aren't really questions, but I have to ask them. He's dead. I don't mean to blame them—they seem well-meaning and kind—but I feel like knowing why it happened could change everything, could let me go back and make it different. If only I could have signaled them to come just a little sooner.

They look at each other, turning their heads uneasily and moving back and forth, but no one answers.

The world is dead... George is dead, that thin, sad figure with bones sticking out, when we sat together for the last time, hands touching, thinking there were people outside who had forgotten us, hoping they'd remember. We didn't know the world was dead, covered in radioactive dust. Politics killed it.

These beings, they had been watching, seeing what would happen to our world, listening to our radios from their settlements on other planets. They saw the war coming. They represented powerful and advanced civilizations with populations that made ours look tiny; they were stronger than us, but they did nothing.

""Why didn't you stop us? You could have stopped us.""

The rabbity one, closer than the others, backs away, politely making room for someone else to speak, but he looks guilty and won't meet my eye. I still feel weak and dizzy. It's hard to think, but I feel like they're hiding something.

A doelike one hesitates, then comes closer to my bed. ""We discussed it... we voted..."" It speaks through a microphone in its helmet with a soft, lisping accent, probably because of its mouth shape. It has a muzzle and very soft, dainty lips like a deer nibbling on twigs.

""We were afraid,"" adds one that looks like a bear.

""To us, the future was very scary,"" says one that seems to have come from a bird like a penguin. ""So many... Your weapons were very scary.""

Now they all talk at once, crowding around my bed, apologizing. ""So much killing. It hurt to know about. But your people didn't seem to mind.""

""We were afraid.""

""And in your fiction,"" the doelike one lisps, ""I saw shows from your entertainment machines that said discovering beings in space would save you from war, not because you would accept our friendship and learn peace, but because humans would unite in hatred of the outsiders. They'd forget their hatred of each other only to hate us more."" Its voice breaks, and it turns away.

""You were about to come into space. We were wondering how to hide!"" says a quick-talking one, small like a child, that looks like it might have come from a bat—gray fur on its pointed face, big eyes, and large ears, with a hump on its air suit that might be folded wings. ""We were trying to hide where we had built, so humans wouldn't find us.""

They're ashamed of their fear, because of it, they broke their civilizations' kind laws, restrained their pity and gentleness, and let us destroy ourselves.

I'm starting to feel more awake and see more clearly. And I'm beginning to feel sorry for them, because I understand why they're afraid.

They are herbivores. I remember the meaning of shapes. In evolution, there are plant eaters and berry eaters and root diggers. Each has its face and neck shape—and its wide, startled eyes to see and run away from hunters. They have never killed to eat. They've been killed and eaten, or they've run away, and they evolved intelligence through survival. Those who ran from carnivores like lions, hawks, and humans lived.

I look up, and they turn their eyes and heads quickly, not meeting my gaze. The rabbity one is nearest, and I reach out to touch him, happy that I can now move my arms. He looks at me, and I ask, ""Are there any meat-eaters among you?""

He hesitates, searching for tactful words. ""We haven't found any that were civilized. We often find them in caves and tents fighting each other. Sometimes we find them with the ruins of cities around them, but they're always savages.""

The bearlike one said heavily, ""Carnivores might evolve faster and tend to intelligence more often, because we find radioactive planets without life, and places like your asteroid belt, where a planet should be—but there are only fragments, like a planet was destroyed. We think that usually..."" He looked at me uncertainly, starting to fumble his words. ""We think...""

""Yours is the only carnivorous race we've found that was civilized, that had a science and was going to explore space,"" the doelike one interrupted softly. ""We were afraid.""

They seem to be apologizing.

The rabbity one, who seems to be the leader in talking to me, says, ""We'll give you anything you want. Anything we can give you.""

They mean it. We survivors will be special, with access to everything in their cities, all for free. Their sincerity is wonderful but puzzling. Are they trying to make up for what they see as a crime; that they let humanity kill itself and lost a rich race to the Galaxy? Is this why they are so generous?

Maybe they'll help the race start again. The records aren't lost. The few survivors can eventually repopulate Earth. Under the guidance of these peaceful races, without the stress of nations, we will thrive. No child of mine, nor their descendants, will ever make war again. We've learned this lesson.

These timid beings don't realize how much humanity has wanted peace. They don't know how we were trapped by old systems and politics we couldn't solve. We aren't naturally savage. We aren't savage when treated as individuals. Maybe they know this but are afraid anyway, instinctive fear from their hunted ancestors.

The human race will be a good partner to these races. Even recovering from starvation, I feel an energy they lack. The savage part of me is a creative force, for in those educated like me, it's a controlled savagery that only attacks and solves problems, not people. Any human raised outside the political traditions inherited from our bloody past would be as friendly as I am to these beings. I could never hurt these kind, overgrown bunnies and squirrels.

""We'll do everything we can to make up for... we'll try to help,"" says the bunny, struggling with English, but polite and kind.

I sit up suddenly, reaching out to shake his hand. Frightened, he leaps back. All of them step back, glancing behind them as if checking their escape route. Their big eyes widen, looking quickly from me to the doors, scared.

They must think I'm about to jump out of bed and attack them. I'm about to laugh and reassure them, about to say all I want is friendship, when I feel a twinge in my stomach from the sudden movement. I touch it under the covers.

There's a scar from an incision, almost healed. An operation. The weakness I'm recovering from is more than just starvation.

For half a second, I don't understand; then I see why they looked ashamed.

They voted to end a race.

All the human survivors have been made sterile. There will be no more humans after us.

I'm frozen, one hand still reaching for the rabbity one's hand, my eyes still searching his face, reassuring words still half-formed.

There will be time for anger or grief later, for now, in this moment, I can understand. They are probably right.

We were carnivores.

I know, because right now, in this moment of hatred, I could kill them all.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around the tension between the human protagonist and the alien beings who have saved her. This tension is driven by the protagonist's deep-seated grief and anger over the loss of humanity, particularly the personal loss of her coworker and love, George Craig. She grapples with the realization that these alien races, despite their advanced civilizations and capacity to intervene, chose not to stop humanity from destroying itself in a nuclear catastrophe due to their fear and misunderstanding of humans as inherently violent carnivores.

The protagonist's dilemma intensifies when she discovers that the aliens have sterilized the human survivors, effectively ending the human race. This act, meant to prevent future violence, is both an act of mercy and a profound violation. The protagonist is torn between understanding the aliens' fear-driven actions and her own visceral reaction of anger and hatred upon realizing that humanity's legacy will end with the current survivors.

This conflict is a poignant exploration of themes such as fear of the unknown, the morality of intervention, and the struggle between instinctive aggression and the desire for peace.

018.txt,"MATILDA’S ears were red and shiny. So were her cheeks. Her hands were red too. This was because Pridmore had washed her. It was not the usual washing, which makes you clean and comfortable, but the “thorough good wash,” which makes you burn and smart till you wish you could be like the poor little savages who do not know anything, and run about bare in the sun, and only go into the water when they are hot.

Matilda wished she could have been born in a savage tribe instead of at Brixton.

“Little savages,” she said, “don’t have their ears washed thoroughly, and they don’t have new dresses that are prickly in the insides round their arms, and cut them round the neck. Do they, Pridmore?”

But Pridmore only said, “Stuff and nonsense,” and then she said, “don’t wriggle so, child, for goodness’ sake.”

Pridmore was Matilda’s nursemaid. Matilda sometimes found her trying. Matilda was quite right in believing that savage children do not wear frocks that hurt. It is also true that savage children are not over-washed, over-brushed, over-combed, gloved, booted, and hatted and taken in an omnibus to Streatham to see their Great-aunt Willoughby. This was intended to be Matilda’s fate. Her mother had arranged it. Pridmore had prepared her for it. Matilda, knowing resistance to be vain, had submitted to it.

But Destiny had not been consulted, and Destiny had plans of its own for Matilda.

When the last button of Matilda’s boots had been fastened (the button-hook always had a nasty temper, especially when it was hurried, and that day it bit a little piece of Matilda’s leg quite spitefully) the wretched child was taken downstairs and put on a chair in the hall to wait while Pridmore popped her own things on.

“I shan’t be a minute,” said Pridmore. Matilda knew better. She seated herself to wait, and swung her legs miserably. She had been to her Great-aunt Willoughby’s before, and she knew exactly what to expect. She would be asked about her lessons, and how many marks she had, and whether she had been a good girl. I can’t think why grown-up people don’t see how impertinent these questions are. Suppose you were to answer, “I’m top of my class, Auntie, thank you, and I’m very good. And now let’s have a little talk about you. Aunt, dear, how much money have you got, and have you been scolding the servants again, or have you tried to be good and patient as a properly brought up aunt should be, eh, dear?”

Try this method with one of your aunts next time she begins asking you questions, and write and tell me what she says.

Matilda knew exactly what the Aunt Willoughby’s questions would be, and she knew how, when they were answered, her aunt would give her a small biscuit with carraway seeds in it, and then tell her to go with Pridmore and have her hands and face washed again.

Then she would be sent to walk in the garden—the garden had a gritty path, and geraniums and calceolarias and lobelias in the beds. You might not pick anything. There would be minced veal at dinner, with three-cornered bits of toast round the dish, and a tapioca pudding. Then the long afternoon with a book, a bound volume of the “Potterer’s Saturday Night”—nasty small print—and all the stories about children who died young because they were too good for this world.

Matilda wriggled wretchedly. If she had been a little less uncomfortable she would have cried, but her new frock was too tight and prickly to let her forget it for a moment, even in tears.

When Pridmore came down at last, she said, “Fie, for shame! What a sulky face!”

And Matilda said, “I’m not.”

“Oh, yes you are,” said Pridmore, “you know you are, you don’t appreciate your blessings.”

“I wish it was your Aunt Willoughby,” said Matilda.

“Nasty, spiteful little thing!” said Pridmore, and she shook Matilda.

Then Matilda tried to slap Pridmore, and the two went down the steps not at all pleased with each other. They went down the dull road to the dull omnibus, and Matilda was crying a little.

Now Pridmore was a very careful person, though cross, but even the most careful persons make mistakes sometimes—and she must have taken the wrong omnibus, or this story could never have happened, and where should we all have been then? This shows you that even mistakes are sometimes valuable, so do not be hard on grown-up people if they are wrong sometimes. You know after all, it hardly ever happens.

It was a very bright green and gold omnibus, and inside the cushions were green and very soft. Matilda and her nursemaid had it all to themselves, and Matilda began to feel more comfortable, especially as she had wriggled till she had burst one of her shoulder-seams and got more room for herself inside her frock.

So she said, “I’m sorry I was cross, Priddy dear.”

Pridmore said, “So you ought to be.” But she never said _she_ was sorry for being cross. But you must not expect grown-up people to say that.

It was certainly the wrong omnibus because instead of jolting slowly along dusty streets, it went quickly and smoothly down a green lane, with flowers in the hedges, and green trees overhead. Matilda was so delighted that she sat quite still, a very rare thing with her. Pridmore was reading a penny story called “The Vengeance of the Lady Constantia,” so she did not notice anything.

“I don’t care. I shan’t tell her,” said Matilda, “she’d stop the ’bus as likely as not.”

At last the ’bus stopped of its own accord. Pridmore put her story in her pocket and began to get out.

“Well, I never!” she said, and got out very quickly and ran round to where the horses were. They were white horses with green harness, and their tails were very long indeed.

“Hi, young man!” said Pridmore to the omnibus driver, “you’ve brought us to the wrong place. This isn’t Streatham Common, this isn’t.”

The driver was the most beautiful omnibus driver you ever saw, and his clothes were like him in beauty. He had white silk stockings and a ruffled silk shirt of white, and his coat and breeches were green and gold. So was the three-cornered hat which he lifted very politely when Pridmore spoke to him.

“I fear,” he said kindly, “that you must have taken, by some unfortunate misunderstanding, the wrong omnibus.”

“When does the next go back?”

“The omnibus does not go back. It runs from Brixton here once a month, but it doesn’t go back.”

“But how does it get to Brixton again, to start again, I mean,” asked Matilda.

“We start a new one every time,” said the driver, raising his three-cornered hat once more.

“And what becomes of the old ones?” Matilda asked.

“Ah,” said the driver, smiling, “that depends. One never knows beforehand, things change so nowadays. Good morning. Thank you so much for your patronage. No, on no account, Madam.”

He waved away the eightpence which Pridmore was trying to offer him for the fare from Brixton, and drove quickly off.

When they looked round them, no, this was certainly not Streatham Common. The wrong omnibus had brought them to a strange village—the neatest, sweetest, reddest, greenest, cleanest, prettiest village in the world. The houses were grouped round a village green, on which children in pretty loose frocks or smocks were playing happily.

Not a tight armhole was to be seen, or even imagined in that happy spot. Matilda swelled herself out and burst three hooks and a bit more of the shoulder seam.

The shops seemed a little queer, Matilda thought. The names somehow did not match the things that were to be sold. For instance, where it said “Elias Groves, Tinsmith,” there were loaves and buns in the window, and the shop that had “Baker” over the door, was full of perambulators—the grocer and the wheelwright seemed to have changed names, or shops, or something—and Miss Skimpling, Dressmaker or Milliner, had her shop window full of pork and sausage meat.

“What a funny, nice place,” said Matilda. “I am glad we took the wrong omnibus.”

A little boy in a yellow smock had come up close to them.

“I beg your pardon,” he said very politely, “but all strangers are brought before the king at once. Please follow me.”

“Well, of all the impudence,” said Pridmore. “Strangers, indeed! And who may you be, I should like to know?”

“I,” said the little boy, bowing very low, “am the Prime Minister. I know I do not look it, but appearances are deceitful. It’s only for a short time. I shall probably be myself again by to-morrow.”

Pridmore muttered something which the little boy did not hear. Matilda caught a few words. “Smacked,” “bed,” “bread and water”—familiar words all of them.

“If it’s a game,” said Matilda to the boy, “I should like to play.”

He frowned.

“I advise you to come at once,” he said, so sternly that even Pridmore was a little frightened. “His Majesty’s Palace is in this direction.” He walked away, and Matilda made a sudden jump, dragged her hand out of Pridmore’s, and ran after him. So Pridmore had to follow, still grumbling.

The Palace stood in a great green park dotted with white-flowered may-bushes. It was not at all like an English palace, St. James’s or Buckingham Palace, for instance, because it was very beautiful and very clean. When they got in they saw that the Palace was hung with green silk. The footmen had green and gold liveries, and all the courtiers’ clothes were the same colours.

Matilda and Pridmore had to wait a few moments while the King changed his sceptre and put on a clean crown, and then they were shown into the Audience Chamber. The King came to meet them.

“It is kind of you to have come so far,” he said. “Of _course_ you’ll stay at the Palace?” He looked anxiously at Matilda.

“Are you _quite_ comfortable, my dear?” he asked doubtfully.

Matilda was very truthful—for a girl.

“No,” she said, “my frock cuts me round the arms——”

“Ah,” said he, “and you brought no luggage—some of the Princess’s frocks—her old ones perhaps—yes—yes—this person—your maid, no doubt?”

A loud laugh rang suddenly through the hall. The King looked uneasily round, as though he expected something to happen. But nothing seemed likely to occur.

“Yes,” said Matilda, “Pridmore is—Oh, dear!”

For before her eyes she saw an awful change taking place in Pridmore. In an instant all that was left of the original Pridmore were the boots and the hem of her skirt—the top part of her had changed into painted iron and glass, and even as Matilda looked the bit of skirt that was left got flat and hard and square. The two feet turned into four feet, and they were iron feet, and there was no more Pridmore.

“Oh, my poor child,” said the King, “your maid has turned into an Automatic Machine.”

It was too true. The maid had turned into a machine such as those which you see in a railway station—greedy, grasping things which take your pennies and give you next to nothing in chocolate and no change.

But there was no chocolate to be seen through the glass of the machine that once had been Pridmore. Only little rolls of paper.

The King silently handed some pennies to Matilda. She dropped one into the machine and pulled out the little drawer. There was a scroll of paper. Matilda opened it and read—

“Don’t be tiresome.”

She tried again. This time it was—

“If you don’t give over I’ll tell your Ma first thing when she comes home.”

The next was—

“Go along with you do—always worrying;” so then Matilda _knew_.

“Yes,” said the King sadly, “I fear there’s no doubt about it. Your maid has turned into an Automatic Nagging Machine. Never mind, my dear, she’ll be all right to-morrow.”

“I like her best like this, thank you,” said Matilda quickly. “I needn’t put in any more pennies, you see.”

“Oh, we mustn’t be unkind and neglectful,” said the King gently, and he dropped in a penny. _He_ got—

“You tiresome boy, you. Leave me be this minute.”

“I can’t help it,” said the King wearily; “you’ve no idea how suddenly things change here. It’s because—but I’ll tell you all about it at tea-time. Go with nurse now, my dear, and see if any of the Princess’s frocks will fit you.”

Then a nice, kind, cuddly nurse led Matilda away to the Princess’s apartments, and took off the stiff frock that hurt, and put on a green silk gown, as soft as birds’ breasts, and Matilda kissed her for sheer joy at being so comfortable.

“And now, dearie,” said the nurse, “you’d like to see the Princess, wouldn’t you? Take care you don’t hurt yourself with her. She’s rather sharp.”

Matilda did not understand this then. Afterwards she did.

The nurse took her through many marble corridors and up and down many marble steps, and at last they came to a garden full of white roses, and in the middle of it, on a green satin-covered eiderdown, as big as a feather bed, sat the Princess in a white gown.

She got up when Matilda came towards her, and it was like seeing a yard and a half of white tape stand up on one end and bow—a yard and a half of broad white tape, of course; but what is considered broad for tape is very narrow indeed for princesses.

“How are you?” said Matilda, who had been taught manners.

“Very slim indeed, thank you,” said the Princess. And she was. Her face was so white and thin that it looked as though it were made of an oyster-shell. Her hands were thin and white, and her fingers reminded Matilda of fish-bones. Her hair and eyes were black, and Matilda thought she might have been pretty if she had been fatter. When she shook hands with Matilda her bony fingers hurt quite hard.

The Princess seemed pleased to see her visitor, and invited her to sit with Her Highness on the satin cushion.

“I have to be very careful or I should break,” said she; “that’s why the cushion is so soft, and I can’t play many games for fear of accidents. Do you know any sitting-down games?”

The only thing Matilda could think of was Cat’s-cradle, so they played that with the Princess’s green hair-ribbon. Her fish-bony fingers were much cleverer than Matilda’s little fat, pink paws.

Matilda looked about her between the games and admired everything very much, and asked questions, of course. There was a very large bird chained to a perch in the middle of a very large cage. Indeed the cage was so big that it took up all one side of the rose-garden. The bird had a yellow crest like a cockatoo and a very large bill like a toucan. (If you do not know what a toucan is you do not deserve ever to go to the Zoological Gardens again.)

“What is that bird?” asked Matilda.

“Oh,” said the Princess, “that’s my pet Cockatoucan; he’s very valuable. If he were to die or be stolen the Green Land would wither up and grow like New Cross or Islington.”

“How horrible!” said Matilda.

“I’ve never been to those places, of course,” said the Princess, shuddering, “but I hope I know my geography.”

“All of it?” asked Matilda.

“Even the exports and imports,” said the Princess. “Goodbye, I’m so thin I have to rest a good deal or I should wear myself out. Nurse, take her away.”

So nurse took her away to a wonderful room, where she amused herself till tea-time with all the kind of toys that you see and want in the shop when some one is buying you a box of bricks or a puzzle map—the kind of toys you never get because they are so expensive.

Matilda had tea with the King. He was full of true politeness and treated Matilda exactly as though she had been grown up—so that she was extremely happy and behaved beautifully.

The King told her all his troubles.

“You see,” he began, “what a pretty place my Green Land was once. It has points even now. But things aren’t what they used to be. It’s that bird, that Cockatoucan. We daren’t kill it or give it away. And every time it laughs something changes. Look at my Prime Minister. He was a six-foot man. And look at him now. I could lift him with one hand. And then your poor maid. It’s all that bad bird.”

“Why _does_ it laugh?” asked Matilda.

“I can’t think,” said the King; “I can’t see anything to laugh at.”

“Can’t you give it lessons, or something nasty to make it miserable?”

“I have, I do, I assure you, my dear child. The lessons that bird has to swallow would choke a Professor.”

“Does it eat anything else besides lessons?”

“Christmas pudding. But there—what’s the use of talking—that bird would laugh if it were fed on dog-biscuits.”

His Majesty sighed and passed the buttered toast.

“You can’t possibly,” he went on, “have any idea of the kind of things that happen. That bird laughed one day at a Cabinet Council, and all my ministers turned into little boys in yellow socks. And we can’t get any laws made till they come right again. It’s not their fault, and I must keep their situations open for them, of course, poor things.”

“Of course,” said Matilda.

“There was a Dragon, now,” said the King. “When he came I offered the Princess’s hand and half my kingdom to any one who would kill him. It’s an offer that is always made, you know.”

“Yes,” said Matilda.

“Well, a really respectable young Prince came along, and every one turned out to see him fight the Dragon. As much as ninepence each was paid for the front seats, I assure you. The trumpet sounded and the Dragon came hurrying up. A trumpet is like a dinner-bell to a Dragon, you know. And the Prince drew his bright sword and we all shouted, and then that wretched bird laughed and the Dragon turned into a pussy-cat, and the Prince killed it before he could stop himself. The populace was furious.”

“What happened then?” asked Matilda.

“Well, I did what I could. I said, ‘You shall marry the Princess just the same.’ So I brought the Prince home, and when we got there the Cockatoucan had just been laughing again, and the Princess had turned into a very old German governess. The Prince went home in a great hurry and an awful temper. The Princess was all right in a day or two. These are trying times, my dear.”

“I am so sorry for you,” said Matilda, going on with the preserved ginger.

“Well you may be,” said the miserable Monarch; “but if I were to try to tell you all that that bird has brought on my poor kingdom I should keep you up till long past your proper bedtime.”

“I don’t mind,” said Matilda kindly. “Do tell me some more.”

“Why,” the King went on, growing now more agitated, “why, at one titter from that revolting bird the long row of ancestors on my Palace wall grew red-faced and vulgar; they began to drop their H’s and to assert that their name was Smith from Clapham Junction.”

“How dreadful!”

“And once,” said the King in a whimper, “it laughed so loudly that two Sundays came together and next Thursday got lost, and went prowling away and hid itself on the other side of Christmas.”

“And now,” he said suddenly, “it’s bedtime.”

“Must I go?” asked Matilda.

“Yes please,” said the King. “I tell all strangers this tragic story because I always feel that perhaps some stranger might be clever enough to help me. You seem a very nice little girl. Do you think you are clever?”

It is very nice even to be _asked_ if you are clever. Your Aunt Willoughby knows well enough that you are not. But kings do say nice things. Matilda was very pleased.

“I don’t think I am clever,” she was saying quite honestly, when suddenly the sound of a hoarse laugh rang through the banqueting hall. Matilda put her hands to her head.

“Oh, dear!” she cried, “I feel so different. Oh! wait a minute. Oh! whatever is it? Oh!”

Then she was silent for a moment. Then she looked at the King and said, “I was wrong, your Majesty, I _am_ clever, and I know it is not good for me to sit up late. Good-night. Thank you so much for your nice party. In the morning I think I shall be clever enough to help you, unless the bird laughs me back into the other kind of Matilda.”

But in the morning Matilda’s head felt strangely clear; only when she came down to breakfast full of plans for helping the King, she found that the Cockatoucan must have laughed in the night, for the beautiful Palace had turned into a butcher’s shop, and the King, who was too wise to fight against Fate, had tucked up his royal robes, and was busy in the shop weighing out six ounces of the best mutton-chops for a child with a basket.

“I don’t know how ever you can help me now,” he said, despairingly; “as long as the Palace stays like this, it’s no use trying to go on with being a king, or anything. I can only try to be a good butcher. You shall keep the accounts if you like, till that bird laughs me back into my Palace again.”

So the King settled down to business, respected by his subjects, who had all, since the coming of the Cockatoucan, had their little ups and downs. And Matilda kept the books and wrote out the bills, and really they were both rather happy. Pridmore, disguised as the automatic machine, stood in the shop and attracted many customers. They used to bring their children, and make the poor innocents put their pennies in, and then read Pridmore’s good advice. Some parents are so harsh. And the Princess sat in the back garden with the Cockatoucan, and Matilda played with her every afternoon. But one day, as the King was driving through another kingdom, the King of that kingdom looked out of one of his Palace windows, and laughed as the King went by, and shouted, “Butcher!”

The Butcher-King did not mind this, because it was true, however rude. But when the other King called out, “What price cat’s meat!” the King was very angry indeed, because the meat he sold was always of the best quality. When he told Matilda all about it, she said, “Send the Army to crush him.”

So the King sent his Army, and the enemy were crushed. The Bird laughed the King back into his throne, and laughed away the butcher’s shop just in time for his Majesty to proclaim a general holiday, and to organise a magnificent reception for the Army. Matilda now helped the King to manage everything. She wonderfully enjoyed the new delightful feeling of being clever, so that she felt it was indeed too bad when the Cockatoucan laughed just as the reception was beautifully arranged. It laughed, and the general holiday was turned into an income tax; the magnificent reception changed itself to a royal reprimand, and the Army itself suddenly became a discontented Sunday-school treat, and had to be fed with buns and brought home in brakes, crying.

“Something must be done,” said the King.

“Well,” said Matilda, “I’ve been thinking if you will make me the Princess’s governess, I’ll see what I can do. I’m quite clever enough.”

“I must open Parliament to do that,” said the King; “it’s a Constitutional change.”

So he hurried off down the road to open Parliament. But the bird put its head on one side and laughed at him as he went by. He hurried on, but his beautiful crown grew large and brassy, and was set with cheap glass in the worst possible taste. His robe turned from velvet and ermine to flannelette and rabbit’s fur. His sceptre grew twenty feet long and extremely awkward to carry. But he persevered, his royal blood was up.

“No bird,” said he, “shall keep me from my duty and my Parliament.”

But when he got there, he was so agitated that he could not remember which was the right key to open Parliament with, and in the end he hampered the lock and so could not open Parliament at all, and members of Parliament went about making speeches in the roads to the great hindrance of the traffic.

The poor King went home and burst into tears.

“Matilda,” he said, “this is too much. You have always been a comfort to me. You stood by me when I was a butcher; you kept the books; you booked the orders; you ordered the stock. If you really are clever enough, now is the time to help me. If you won’t, I’ll give up the business. I’ll leave off being a King. I’ll go and be a butcher in the Camberwell New Road, and I will get another little girl to keep my books, not you.”

This decided Matilda. She said, “Very well, your Majesty, then give me leave to prowl at night. Perhaps I shall find out what makes the Cockatoucan laugh; if I can do that, we can take care he never gets it, whatever it is.”

“Ah!” said the poor King, “if you could only do that.”

When Matilda went to bed that night, she did not go to sleep. She lay and waited till all the Palace was quiet, and then she crept softly, pussily, mousily to the garden, where the Cockatoucan’s cage was, and she hid behind a white rosebush, and looked and listened. Nothing happened till it was gray dawn, and then it was only the Cockatoucan who woke up. But when the sun was round and red over the Palace roof, something came creeping, creeping, pussily, mousily out of the Palace; and it looked like a yard and a half of white tape creeping along; and it was the Princess herself.

She came quietly up to the cage, and squeezed herself between the bars; they were very narrow bars, but a yard and a half of white tape can go through the bars of any birdcage I ever saw. And the Princess went up to the Cockatoucan and tickled him under his wings till he laughed aloud. Then, quick as thought, the Princess squeezed through the bars, and was back in her room before the bird had finished laughing. Matilda went back to bed. Next day all the sparrows had turned into cart horses, and the roads were impassable.

That day when she went, as usual, to play with the Princess, Matilda said to her suddenly, “Princess, what makes you so thin?”

The Princess caught Matilda’s hand and pressed it with warmth.

“Matilda,” she said simply, “you have a noble heart. No one else has ever asked me that, though they tried to cure it. And I couldn’t answer till I was asked, could I? It’s a sad, a tragic tale, Matilda. I was once as fat as you are.”

“I’m not so very fat,” said Matilda, indignantly.

“Well,” said the Princess impatiently, “I was quite fat enough anyhow. And then I got thin—”

“But how?”

“Because they would not let me have my favourite pudding every day.”

“What a shame!” said Matilda, “and what is your favourite pudding?”

“Bread and milk, of course, sprinkled with rose leaves—and with pear-drops in it.”

Of course, Matilda went at once to the King, and while she was on her way the Cockatoucan happened to laugh. When she reached the King, he was in no condition for ordering dinner, for he had turned into a villa-residence, replete with every modern improvement. Matilda only recognised him, as he stood sadly in the Park, by the crown that stuck crookedly on one of the chimney-pots, and the border of ermine along the garden path. So she ordered the Princess’s favourite pudding on her own responsibility, and the whole Court had it every day for dinner, till there was no single courtier but loathed the very sight of bread and milk, and there was hardly one who would not have run a mile rather than meet a pear-drop. Even Matilda herself got rather tired of it, though being clever, she knew how good bread and milk was for her.

But the Princess got fatter and fatter, and rosier and rosier. Her thread-paper gowns had to be let out, and let out, till there were no more turnings in left to be let out, and then she had to wear the old ones that Matilda had been wearing, and then to have new ones. And as she got fatter she got kinder, till Matilda grew quite fond of her.

And the Cockatoucan had not laughed for a month.

When the Princess was as fat as any Princess ought to be, Matilda went to her one day, and threw her arms round her and kissed her. The Princess kissed her back, and said, “Very well, I _am_ sorry then, but I didn’t want to say so, but now I will. And the Cockatoucan never laughs except when he’s tickled. So there! He hates to laugh.”

“And you won’t do it again,” said Matilda, “will you?”

“No, of course not,” said the Princess, very much surprised, “why should I? I was spiteful when I was thin, but now I’m fat again I want every one to be happy.”

“But how can any one be happy?” asked Matilda, severely, “when every one is turned into something they weren’t meant to be? There’s your dear father—he’s a desirable villa—the Prime Minister was a little boy, and he got back again, and now he’s turned into a Comic Opera. Half the Palace housemaids are breakers, dashing themselves against the Palace crockery: the Navy, to a man, are changed to French poodles, and the Army to German sausages. Your favourite nurse is now a flourishing steam laundry, and I, alas! am too clever by half. Can’t that horrible bird do anything to put us all right again?”

“No,” said the Princess, dissolved in tears at this awful picture, “he told me once himself that when he laughed he could only change one or two things at once, and then, as often as not, it turned out to be something he didn’t expect. The only way to make everything come right again would be—but it can’t be done! If we could only make him laugh on the wrong side of his mouth. That’s the secret. He told me so. But I don’t know what it _is_, let alone being able to do it. Could _you_ do it, Matilda?”

“No,” said Matilda, “but let me whisper. He’s listening. Pridmore could. She’s often told me she’d do it to me. But she never has. Oh, Princess, I’ve got an idea.”

The two were whispering so low that the Cockatoucan could not hear, though he tried his hardest. Matilda and the Princess left him listening.

Presently he heard a sound of wheels. Four men came into the rose-garden wheeling a great red thing in a barrow. They set it down in front of the Cockatoucan, who danced on his perch with rage.

“Oh,” he said, “if only some one would make me laugh, that horrible thing would be the one to change. I know it would. It would change into something much horrider than it is now. I feel it in all my feathers.”

The Princess opened the cage-door with the Prime Minister’s key, which a tenor singer had found at the beginning of his music. It was also the key of the comic opera. She crept up behind the Cockatoucan and tickled him under both wings. He fixed his baleful eye on the red Automatic Machine and laughed long and loud; he saw the red iron and glass change before his eyes into the form of Pridmore. Her cheeks were red with rage and her eyes shone like glass with fury.

“Nice manners!” said she to the Cockatoucan, “what are you laughing at, I should like to know—I’ll make you laugh on the wrong side of your mouth, my fine fellow!”

She sprang into the cage, and then and there, before the astonished Court, she shook that Cockatoucan till he really and truly did laugh on the wrong side of his mouth. It was a terrible sight to witness, and the sound of that wrong-sided laughter was horrible to hear.

But instantly all the things changed back as if by magic to what they had been before. The laundry became a nurse, the villa became a king, the other people were just what they had been before, and all Matilda’s wonderful cleverness went out like the snuff of a candle.

The Cockatoucan himself fell in two—one half of him became a common, ordinary Toucan, such as you must have seen a hundred times at the Zoo, unless you are unworthy to visit that happy place, and the other half became a weathercock, which, as you know, is always changing and makes the wind change too. So he has not quite lost his old power. Only now he is in halves, any power he may have has to be used without laughing. The poor, broken Cockatoucan, like King you-know-who in English history, has never since that sad day smiled again.

The grateful King sent an escort of the whole Army, now no longer dressed in sausage skins, but in uniforms of dazzling beauty, with drums and banners, to see Matilda and Pridmore home. But Matilda was very sleepy. She had been clever for so long that she was quite tired out. It is indeed a very fatiguing thing, as no doubt you know. And the soldiers must have been sleepy too, for one by one the whole Army disappeared, and by the time Pridmore and Matilda reached home there was only one left, and he was the policeman at the corner.

The next day Matilda began to talk to Pridmore about the Green Land and the Cockatoucan and the Villa-residence-King, but Pridmore only said—

“Pack of nonsense! Hold your tongue, do!”

So Matilda naturally understood that Pridmore did not wish to be reminded of the time when she was an Automatic Nagging Machine, so of course, like a kind and polite little girl, she let the subject drop.

Matilda did not mention her adventures to the others at home because she saw that they believed her to have spent the time with her Great-aunt Willoughby.

And she knew if she had said that she had not been there she would be sent at once—and she did not wish this.

She has often tried to get Pridmore to take the wrong omnibus again, which is the only way she knows of getting to the Green Land; but only once has she been successful, and then the omnibus did not go to the Green Land at all, but to the Elephant and Castle.

But no little girl ought to expect to go to the Green Land more than once in a lifetime. Many of us indeed are not even so fortunate as to go there once.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Matilda's struggle between the oppressive, mundane reality of her life in Brixton and the whimsical, unpredictable world of the Green Land. In Brixton, Matilda is subjected to the strictures of her nursemaid, Pridmore, and the expectations of her family, which include uncomfortable clothes, rigorous cleanliness, and tedious visits to her Great-aunt Willoughby. This life is marked by a lack of agency and freedom.

The conflict intensifies when Matilda and Pridmore inadvertently take the wrong omnibus to the Green Land, a place where the ordinary rules do not apply, and everything is subject to change at the whims of the Cockatoucan's laughter. Here, the dilemma shifts to finding a way to stop the chaotic transformations caused by the Cockatoucan, which have upended the lives of the King and his subjects.

Matilda's desire for adventure and her eventual cleverness provide a temporary resolution to the conflict, as she helps restore order in the Green Land by uncovering the cause of the Cockatoucan's laughter—the Princess's actions—and devising a plan to stop it. In the end, Matilda returns to her ordinary life, but with the knowledge and satisfaction of having experienced a magical adventure and having been instrumental in resolving the chaos in the Green Land.

022.txt,"What a strange moment it is when you first wake up in the middle of the night and are just starting to gather your thoughts! As you suddenly open your eyes, it feels like you've caught the characters of your dreams gathered around your bed, and you get one clear look at them before they vanish into the shadows. Or, to put it another way, you find yourself, just for a brief moment, wide awake in that land of illusions where sleep is the ticket, and you see its ghostly residents and amazing scenery in a way you never can during an undisturbed dream. You faintly hear the sound of a church clock carried by the wind. You wonder, half seriously, if it's drifted to your waking ears from some gray tower that stood in your dream. While you think about it, another clock chimes loudly over the quiet town, with such a clear and long-lasting sound that you're sure it's from the steeple at the nearest corner. You count the chimes—one—two, and they stop, with a deep sound, like the gathering of a third chime within the bell.

If you could choose a time to be awake in the whole night, it would be now. Since your sensible bedtime at eleven, you've had enough rest to ease the tiredness of yesterday; and before you, until the sun rises in the east to brighten your window, there is almost a whole summer night; one hour to spend in thought, with your mind's eye half shut, and two in pleasant dreams, and two in that strangest of pleasures, the forgetfulness of both joy and sorrow. The moment of getting up belongs to another time and seems so far away that the thought of leaving a warm bed for the cold air doesn't seem so bad yet. Yesterday has already disappeared into the shadows of the past; tomorrow hasn't yet appeared from the future. You've found a middle space where the business of life doesn't intrude; where the passing moment lingers and becomes truly the present; a place where Father Time, thinking no one is watching, sits down by the roadside to catch his breath. Oh, if only he would fall asleep and let people live on without growing older!

So far, you've lain perfectly still because even the slightest movement would scatter the fragments of your sleep. Now, being fully awake, you peek through the partly open window curtain and notice that the glass is decorated with intricate designs in frost, and each pane looks like a frozen dream. There will be plenty of time to draw the comparison while waiting for the call to breakfast. Seen through the clear part of the glass, where the silver mountain peaks of the frost scenery don't reach, the most noticeable object is the steeple, its white spire pointing to the wintry brightness of the sky. You can almost see the figures on the clock that just chimed the hour. Such a frosty sky, the snow-covered roofs, the long stretch of the frozen street, all white, and the distant water turned to rock, might make you shiver, even under four blankets and a woolen comforter. Yet look at that one glorious star! Its beams stand out from all the rest and even cast the shadow of the window on the bed, with a glow deeper than moonlight, though not as sharp in outline.

You sink back and cover your head with the bedclothes, shivering not so much from the cold itself as from the very idea of a polar atmosphere. It's too cold for even your thoughts to venture outside. You think about the luxury of spending a whole life in bed, like an oyster in its shell, content with the slow joy of doing nothing, and drowsily aware of nothing but the delicious warmth, such as you now feel again. Ah! that thought has brought an awful one in its wake. You think of how the dead are lying in their cold shrouds and narrow coffins, through the dreary winter of the grave, and you can't convince your mind that they neither shrink nor shiver when the snow is drifting over their little mounds, and the bitter wind howls against the tomb door. That gloomy thought will gather a gloomy crowd and cast its color over your wakeful hour.

In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may make us forget their existence, and the buried ones or prisoners they hide. But sometimes, and often at midnight, these dark places are flung wide open. In a moment like this, when the mind is sensitive but not strong; when the imagination is a mirror, reflecting all ideas vividly, without the power to choose or control them; then pray that your sorrows may sleep, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain. It's too late! A funeral procession glides by your bed, where Passion and Feeling take shape, and things of the mind become dreadful specters to the eye. There is your earliest Sorrow, a pale young mourner, resembling first love, sadly beautiful, with a sacred sweetness in her melancholy features, and grace in the flow of her dark robe. Next appears a shade of ruined beauty, with dust in her golden hair, and her bright clothes all faded and damaged, slipping from your view with a drooping head, as if afraid of reproach; she was your fondest Hope, but a deceptive one; so call her Disappointment now. A more severe form follows, with a wrinkled brow, a look and gesture of iron authority; there's no name for him unless it be Fate, a symbol of the evil influence that rules your fortunes; a demon to whom you bound yourself by some mistake early in life and were made his slave forever by obeying him once. See! those fiendish features engraved on the darkness, the twisted lip of scorn, the mockery of that living eye, the pointed finger, touching the sore spot in your heart! Do you remember any act of enormous foolishness, at which you would blush, even in the furthest cave of the earth? Then recognize your Shame.

Pass, wretched band! Well for the awake one if, wildly miserable, a fiercer group doesn't surround him, the demons of a guilty heart, that holds its hell within itself. What if Remorse should take on the features of a wronged friend? What if the fiend should appear in woman's clothes, with pale beauty amid sin and ruin, and lie down by your side? What if he should stand at your bed's foot, like a corpse, with a bloody stain on the shroud? It's heavy enough without such guilt, this nightmare of the soul; this heavy, heavy sinking of the spirits; this wintry gloom about the heart; this unclear horror of the mind, blending itself with the darkness of the room.

With a desperate effort, you sit upright, breaking from a sort of conscious sleep, and gazing wildly around the bed, as if the fiends were anywhere but in your haunted mind. At the same moment, the sleeping embers on the hearth send forth a gleam that faintly lights up the whole outer room and flickers through the bedchamber door but can't quite dispel its darkness. Your eye searches for whatever may remind you of the living world. With eager attention, you note the table near the fireplace, the book with an ivory knife between its pages, the unfolded letter, the hat, and the fallen glove. Soon the flame fades, and with it, the whole scene is gone, though its image remains for an instant in your mind's eye, when darkness has swallowed the reality. Throughout the chamber, there is the same obscurity as before, but not the same gloom within your heart. As your head falls back upon the pillow, you think—in a whisper be it spoken—how pleasant in these night solitudes would be the rise and fall of a softer breathing than your own, the slight pressure of a tenderer bosom, the quiet throb of a purer heart, imparting its peacefulness to your troubled one, as if the fond sleeper were involving you in her dream.

Her influence is over you, though she has no existence but in that momentary image. You sink down in a flowery spot, on the borders of sleep and wakefulness, while your thoughts rise before you in pictures, all disconnected, yet all united by a pervasive joy and beauty. The wheeling of splendid squadrons, that shine in the sun, is followed by the laughter of children around the door of a schoolhouse, beneath the flickering shadow of old trees, at the corner of a rustic lane. You stand in the sunny rain of a summer shower, and wander among the sunny trees of an autumnal wood, and look up at the brightest of all rainbows, arching over the unbroken sheet of snow, on the American side of Niagara. Your mind struggles happily between the dancing radiance around the hearth of a young man and his recent bride, and the twittering flight of birds in spring, about their new-made nest. You feel the happy bounding of a ship before the breeze; and watch the lively feet of rosy girls, as they twine their last and merriest dance in a splendid ballroom; and find yourself in the glittering circle of a crowded theater, as the curtain falls over a light and airy scene.

With an involuntary start, you seize hold of consciousness, and prove yourself but half awake, by drawing a doubtful parallel between human life and the hour which has now passed. In both, you emerge from mystery, pass through a change that you can but imperfectly control, and are carried onward to another mystery. Now comes the peal of the distant clock, with fainter and fainter strokes as you plunge further into the wilderness of sleep. It is the knell of a temporary death. Your spirit has departed and roams like a free citizen, among the people of a shadowy world, seeing strange sights, yet without wonder or fear. So calm, perhaps, will be the final change; so undisturbed, as if among familiar things, the entrance of the soul to its Eternal home!",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around the narrator's struggle with their own thoughts and emotions during a moment of wakefulness in the middle of the night. This introspective moment leads them into a mental landscape where they confront various specters of their past, including sorrow, disappointment, fate, shame, and remorse. These manifestations represent the narrator's inner turmoil and unresolved feelings, which blend with the eerie, dreamlike atmosphere of the night.

The story explores the tension between the comfort and warmth of the present moment in bed and the haunting memories and regrets that resurface. The narrator grapples with the transient nature of life and consciousness, reflecting on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. This internal struggle is further compounded by the longing for connection and peace, symbolized by the imagined presence of a comforting companion.

Ultimately, the narrative delves into the duality of human experience—caught between wakefulness and dreams, past and future, reality and illusion—and the desire to find solace and understanding amidst the chaos of one's thoughts.","Imagine waking up to find your deepest fears and regrets staring back at you—do you confront them, or hide under the covers?","If your inner demons took form in the shadows, would you confront them bravely or retreat into the warmth of your blankets?",What if the haunting specters of your past danced around your bed in the dark—would you join them or chase them away?,fantasy,tragedy,coming of age,What does the narrator hear in the middle of the night?,The narrator hears the sound of a church clock chiming in the middle of the night.,Why does the narrator feel like they are in a 'middle space' during the night?,"The narrator feels like they are in a 'middle space' because they are between the past day and the coming day, in a moment where time seems to pause and the usual concerns of life do not intrude.",How does the narrator's imagination affect their experience of waking up at night?,"The narrator's imagination makes the experience vivid and surreal, as they visualize dream-like figures and scenes, and their thoughts wander to both comforting and unsettling places.",What role does the imagery of cold and warmth play in the story?,"The imagery of cold and warmth contrasts the comfort of the narrator's bed with the harshness of the outside world, symbolizing the tension between safety and vulnerability, and reflecting the narrator's internal struggle between peace and haunting thoughts.",Do you think the narrator's reflections during the night are positive or negative?

024.txt,"The riot began late on a Sunday afternoon, in the alley behind John McCullough's house. John was there when it started, and he was there when it ended.

On Centaurus II, a day lasts thirty hours, so Sundays are long. That Sunday, John had just finished putting the windows in the log house he was building. Now, he was relaxing on the back porch with a bottle of local whiskey. It tasted strange, but it was alcoholic, and he had gotten used to it.

In the kitchen, John's wife was making Sunday dinner on their new stove, amazed at how easy it was to use compared to the wood stove they had back on the farm. Their two kids were playing around the house. Henry Watts, who lived across the street, and Pete Tallant, who lived next door, had helped John with the windows, and now they were helping him finish the bottle. They were talking about the natives. This conversation was the start of the riot.

""It's not that I hate them,"" said Henry Watts. ""They just shouldn't be in an Earthling town. If they keep coming, soon there'll be more natives than us. Then it won't be safe for a woman to walk down the street.""

""Yeah, I guess so,"" John said. He wasn't too interested, though. His family came from a farming area upriver, where they were among the first settlers, and he hadn't seen many native Centaurans until he moved to Knakvik to work on the spaceport. He wasn't the type to worry about things that didn't involve him directly. He liked to mind his own business.

""What the government should do,"" Watts continued, ""is round them all up and put them on a reservation. You can't make a civilized person out of a grayskin; they're not even human.""

""Nonsense,"" Pete Tallant said. Watts was a miner and construction worker, while John was a farmer picking up extra money, and Tallant was an intellectual. He was annoyed, but he knew arguing wouldn't change Watts' mind. Tallant thought about how people had only been on this planet for a little over a hundred years, and already there was hate and distrust. There were about a hundred thousand humans and five million natives on this planet, but somehow, there wasn't enough room for both.

""You think I'm prejudiced,"" Watts said defensively. ""But I've lived with them. You city folks come here and think you know everything. Right, John?""

""Yeah, I guess,"" John said absentmindedly.

""The old ones aren't so bad,"" Watts said. ""They know their place, but the young ones, especially the ones who've been to school, are getting out of hand.""

""Let's talk about something else,"" Tallant said. ""Like baseball or something.""

Watts was angry now. ""You don't know what you're talking about. You read all this stuff about the noble Centaurans, but they're just dirty, sneaky non-humans."" He pointed to a group of natives walking by. ""There's your noble Centaurans,"" he said.

A group of natives was walking up the alley. They were small, gray-skinned, and walked with their eyes downcast. Five males were followed by a female carrying a baby.

""You see that woman with her baby?"" Watts said. ""Watch this."" He waved at the woman to come over.

She stopped, looking scared.

""Yes, you,"" Watts barked. ""Come here!""

She looked at the males, who mumbled something to her. She slowly walked toward Watts, looking at the ground. Watts took a coin from his pocket and held it out to her.

""Here,"" he said. ""Feed the baby and get money.""

The native woman took the coin and looked at the men uncertainly. ""Feed?"" she asked in her high voice.

""That's right,"" Watts said. ""Feed the baby."" He grinned at Tallant. ""Watch this, kid.""

""Oh, come on,"" Tallant said. ""I know they feed their young by bringing food up from their stomachs. So it's gross to us. So what?"" He walked over, took the woman's arm, and turned her around. ""No feeding,"" he said. ""Run along.""

Watts' face turned red. ""What do you think you're doing?"" he shouted. He grabbed the woman's arm. ""Feed,"" he said. ""You took my money, now feed!""

""Let her go,"" Tallant said, ""or I'll hit you."" He turned to the group of males. ""Come on, take her and go."" One of them started walking over. Tallant let go of the woman's arm and stepped forward to face Watts. ""I told you to let go,"" he said.

Watts shoved his face close. ""Make me.""

Tallant punched Watts in the face.

Watts was big and tough. He shook his head, saw the blood on his hand, and roared with anger. It wasn't much of a fight. Watts' first punch stunned Tallant, the second knocked him down, and then Watts kicked him in the head.

The native woman still stood there, confused. She ran over, pushed the coin at Watts, and chattered in her own language. Watts twisted the coin from her fingers and shoved her down on top of Tallant. ""There,"" he roared, ""get a good whiff of one!""

She was still holding the baby, trying to protect it, but she fell heavily on it. The baby screamed. One of the males pulled out a knife and started toward Watts.

McCullough had started down the porch when Watts kicked Tallant. He ran behind the native and hit him in the neck. The native fell, and his knife flew out of his hand.

People were watching now, coming out of their homes.

""That dirty native,"" Watts bellowed, ""he tried to knife me!""

He kicked the downed Centauran. The other four males turned and ran.

Most of the humans didn't know what was happening. They saw a couple of natives and a man on the ground, another man shouting about a knife, and four natives running.

""Stop them!"" someone called. ""They'll get away!""

That's how the riot in Port Knakvik started.

Watts ran after the mob chasing the natives. McCullough was left with Tallant and the two natives. The woman seemed unhurt. Tallant was unconscious. McCullough carried him into the house.

His wife stood, white-faced, at the door.

""Get some water,"" he said. He laid Tallant on a cot and wiped his face. Tallant groaned and opened his eyes.

""How do you feel?"" McCullough asked.

""Rough,"" Tallant mumbled. ""Side ... hurts....""

McCullough checked for injuries. ""Looks like a cracked rib,"" he said. ""Get me some tape, Mary?"" He wrapped Tallant's chest tightly.

""That'll hold till you see a doctor,"" he said.

Tallant took a breath. ""Feels better,"" he said. ""What happened?""

McCullough explained.

""That's bad,"" Tallant said. ""Watts could start a real riot. Somebody should tell the marshal before things get worse."" He touched his head tenderly. ""I'll need stitches before this sets up hard. Can you back my truck into the street? I can't drive, but it can take me to the dispensary on auto, and I can call for help from there.""

Tallant had a company truck that could drive itself on paved roads. ""I don't know,"" McCullough said. ""Think you can make it on auto? What if you get stuck?""

""Maybe I could find someone else to drive you,"" McCullough said. ""You lie down for a minute."" He looked outside and saw a man he knew. ""Hey, George,"" he called. ""Can you do me a favor?"" He explained about Tallant.

George was curious about what was happening and agreed to help. They got Tallant into the truck, and George backed it into the street. Tallant gave him the coordinates, and they headed to town.

McCullough turned to see what was happening down the street. There were two columns of smoke and scattered shots. Two men were helping another with a bandaged leg.

""What's going on, John?"" a man across the street asked.

""Not sure. Fighting with the natives, I guess. Watts and some guys chased a couple of them down there. Looks like they want to drive them all out.""

""That's not right,"" the man said. ""The natives have a right to live too. Somebody should do something about it.""

""Pete just went into town to tell the marshal.""

""Yeah, well, I wouldn't call the cops on my neighbors, but I won't join in either."" The man went inside and closed the door.

The riot was none of McCullough's business, but he was nervous. He couldn't see much, just a lot of activity. He shook his head. All this from two men with nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon.

Then he heard a scream—Mary's scream, suddenly cut off!

McCullough ran back to the house, angry at himself for leaving Mary and the kids alone. No one was in the front room, but he saw a native in the kitchen looking out the window.

McCullough's gun hung over the door. He grabbed it and stepped into the kitchen. Two natives were there: the roughed-up one from earlier, watching Mary and the kids, and the one at the window. They turned to face him.

""You hurt, Mary?"" McCullough asked.

She was terrified but managed a small shake of her head.

He looked back at the natives. He should probably have them arrested, but he didn't want to lose a day's work in court. He gestured with the gun. ""Okay,"" he said roughly. ""Get out. Now.""

The natives looked at each other. Outside, there were shots and screams. The native by the window wet his lips and shook his head. The other one held a knife.

""No,"" he said. ""No go outside. Kill.""

McCullough shot him in the belly. The charge nearly tore him in half.

The other native lunged at McCullough, and he fired again. The native fell to the floor.

McCullough stepped over them to the back door and looked out, reloading his gun. Several white men were in the alley, looking around. Henry Watts was with them. He saw McCullough and called out, ""You hear those shots? Two of them ran back up this alley. You see them?""

""They came in my house,"" McCullough said. ""I shot both of them.""

""Good,"" Watts yelled. ""That's two we don't have to worry about.""

""There's one more left,"" another man called. ""He went through Gordon's lot.""

The men ran off, and McCullough turned back inside. Mary was sobbing at the table, the kids clinging to her, staring at the bodies.

McCullough walked over and patted her back. ""It's okay now, Mary,"" he said. ""Nothing to worry about."" She continued crying, and he stood there awkwardly.

He noticed the dark blood of the natives spreading over the kitchen floor. The floor stained easily. He got a tarp and rolled the bodies onto it. One was still alive, bleeding to death. McCullough wished his aim had been better. He didn't feel responsible, but he couldn't let the native bleed out.

He tied a tourniquet on the leg, laid the native on a cot, and pushed the corpse under it. The injured native said nothing.

Then he heard voices outside.

Henry Watts and some men were there, carrying another native corpse.

""You still got those two grayskins in there?"" Watts asked.

McCullough nodded.

""Good. We'll take them now."" Watts started up the steps.

""Wait a minute,"" McCullough said. ""What are you going to do with them?""

""We're going to hang them up as a warning,"" Watts said. ""We'll teach those grayskins what to expect if they come around here again. Come on, toss them out.""

""Well, I don't know,"" McCullough said. ""One of them is still alive.""

Watts grinned. ""That won't be a problem.""

McCullough shook his head. ""No,"" he said. ""I think we better wait for the cops.""

Watts laughed. ""There aren't going to be any cops. We're handling this ourselves. Don't worry about the cops. They won't convict anyone for killing a native.""

""I'm not worried,"" McCullough said, ""but I don't like what you're doing, and I'm not going to be part of it. Those natives stay until the law comes.""

Watts' grin faded. ""John, we're serious. I know you're not a native-lover, but we're going to clean them out. If you won't let us in, we'll come in anyway.""

McCullough shook his head. ""This is my house. I just shot two people for coming in without knocking.""

The men behind Watts didn't seem eager to break in. Watts turned back to McCullough. ""You're just making trouble for yourself.""

McCullough didn't move from the door.

Watts looked around. One man shrugged and turned away, and the others followed.

""All right,"" Watts growled. ""I'll remember this. Native-lover!"" He spat and left.

McCullough watched them go, uneasy. He liked being on good terms with his neighbors, and he knew this would be held against him. It worried him more for Mary and the kids than for himself.

Mary came up behind him.

""What did they want?"" she asked.

He told her.

""But, John, why? Haven't we had enough trouble today? Do you have to fight with your neighbors over a stupid native? What difference does it make?""

McCullough shook his head. ""I don't know. I just don't like the idea, that's all.""

Mary stared at him. She went back to the kitchen, sat down, and began crying again. The kids clung to her, also crying. McCullough paced the living room, watching the street. The native lay silent on the cot, following McCullough with his eyes.

McCullough studied the Centauran. Goddam natives, all they cause is trouble. He loosened the strap on the leg until fresh blood oozed out, then tightened it again. The native winced but said nothing. Would morphine work on a Centauran? He didn't know.

He sat by the window with the gun across his knees. The riot seemed to still be going. Men ran by outside, shouting. Once, several carried a Centauran corpse tied to a pole. No women or children were in sight, and the tent-flaps were closed. There was no sign of authorities trying to stop the riot. Maybe Tallant hadn't gotten through, or maybe Watts was right, and the Administration was staying out of it.

After a while, Mary brought him food. ""You think there'll be more trouble?"" she asked. ""They won't bother us again, will they?""

McCullough chewed thoughtfully. ""Well, that Henry's pretty bull-headed.""

""Don't you be bull-headed too, John. I know you have to do what you think is right, but please be careful.""

He took her hand. ""Honey, I'm sorry. It's tough on women sometimes, but a man can't give in on some things."" He looked at their hands, his large brown one holding her small white one. The contrast seemed important, though he couldn't figure out why.

""Don't worry, Mary,"" he said. ""It'll be okay.""

It was almost sundown when Watts came back. McCullough was checking the native's leg when he heard a commotion outside.

""John McCullough,"" a voice shouted. ""Come out!""

Watts' voice. McCullough picked up his gun but decided not to face his neighbors with a gun in hand. He looked around. The axe he'd used earlier leaned against the wall.

""Get in the bedroom, Mary,"" he said. ""Pull the mattress off the bed and lie behind it with the kids.""

He took the axe and walked outside, squinting against the setting sun. The street was full of men. Watts and a stout man stood halfway up the path. McCullough studied them.

""Well?"" he said.

""This man's a deputy marshal, John,"" Watts said. ""We'll take your prisoner and the body now.""

The stout man grinned. ""That's right, Mr. McCullough, I've deputized Mr. Watts and others to restore order. We've rounded up all the rioters except the one you've got.""

""You got a warrant?"" McCullough asked.

""Well, no, I don't think—""

""Then get off my property."" McCullough came down the steps. ""Get out of my yard!"" he said. He didn't raise his voice.

""You're bucking the law now, John,"" Watts warned.

""Get out of my yard!"" McCullough said again. He was three steps away from Watts. He took another step.

Watts had a pistol. His arm started to swing up. McCullough let out a bark: ""Haugh!"" and the axe swung in a short arc. He stepped over Watts' body. ""Get out of my yard!"" he said.

The men backed away, uncertain. McCullough was in a half-mindless rage, and he didn't care if there was a fight. He knew he could kill any man who stood against him.

Off to the side, a man lifted a pistol. McCullough turned and began walking toward him, eyes intent. The men in between moved back.

The man with the pistol glanced around and saw he was alone. He jerked the trigger and ran without seeing where his shot went. The charge snapped two feet over McCullough's head.

McCullough turned back to the main group and walked forward. ""Get out of my yard!"" he said.

The men weren't cowards, but this was different. They faced one of their own kind. If they could see him as an outcast, it would be easier. But they knew McCullough wasn't a native-lover. He was standing up for his rights as a citizen. It put them in a difficult position, and McCullough's steady advance didn't give them time to think.

Half a dozen men were backing away. The marshal had disappeared. No one started anything, and they faded back. McCullough kept walking, and the distance between him and the nearest man increased. He stopped in the street, but the mob kept moving. A dozen men stopped at the corner, muttering. One raised a gun, and another knocked it down. They stood a little longer, then moved off. The riot was over.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the tension between the human settlers and the native Centaurans on the planet Centaurus II. This tension is fueled by prejudice, fear, and misunderstanding, which ultimately ignites a riot in the town of Port Knakvik. The story explores themes of racism, colonialism, and the moral dilemmas faced by individuals caught in a conflict between their community's attitudes and their own sense of justice and humanity.

John McCullough, the protagonist, finds himself in a dilemma when he is caught between the racist sentiments of his neighbors, led by Henry Watts, and his own moral compass. Although initially indifferent to the native Centaurans, McCullough is forced to confront the violence and hatred when it directly impacts his life. He is compelled to make a stand when his neighbors, in the guise of restoring order, demand he hand over a wounded native and a body to be lynched as a warning to the others.

McCullough's decision to protect the native in his home, despite the potential repercussions from his neighbors, highlights the story's central moral dilemma: whether to conform to the prevailing racist attitudes or to uphold justice and humanity. This conflict is further complicated by the pressure to maintain good relations with his community for the sake of his family.

In essence, the story examines the individual's struggle to navigate societal pressures and personal ethics in a racially charged environment, ultimately questioning what it means to be human and humane in the face of prejudice and violence.",Imagine your neighbors demand you hand over someone to be lynched—do you give in or stand your ground?,Would you protect a wounded stranger if it meant turning against your entire community?,"If standing up for what’s right could put your family at risk, would you still do it?",science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,Where did the riot begin?,The riot began in the alley behind John McCullough's house.,Why did the riot start?,"The riot started because of tensions and prejudices between the humans and the native Centaurans, which escalated when Henry Watts provoked a native woman and a fight broke out.",What might happen if John had not intervened during the fight?,"If John had not intervened, the native with the knife might have seriously injured or killed Henry Watts, potentially escalating the violence even further.",How does the setting of Centaurus II contribute to the story?,"The setting of Centaurus II, with its long days and a mix of human settlers and native Centaurans, creates a backdrop of cultural tension and unfamiliarity, which contributes to the misunderstandings and prejudices that lead to the riot.",Do you think John McCullough made the right decision by standing up to his neighbors? Why or why not?,"John McCullough's decision to stand up to his neighbors can be seen as morally right because he refused to participate in the lynching of the natives and stood up for justice, even though it put him at odds with his community. However, it also put his family at risk and isolated him from his neighbors.",What could have been done differently to prevent the riot?,"To prevent the riot, there could have been more efforts to foster understanding and communication between the humans and the native Centaurans, perhaps through community meetings or cultural exchanges.

025.txt,"Between two tall stone posts, we could see the gray front of the old parsonage at the end of an avenue lined with black-ash trees. It had been a year since the funeral of the elderly clergyman, the last person who lived there, had left that gateway for the village cemetery. The path leading to the door was almost covered with grass, providing snacks for a few stray cows and an old white horse. The shadows between the house and the road made the place seem like it was part of a dream, rather than the real world. It was a perfect home for a clergyman—secluded yet not too far from life, offering privacy and peace.

The Old Manse had always been home to priests until the summer afternoon I moved in. A priest had built it; other priests had lived there over the years. Children born in the house grew up to become priests themselves. It was amazing to think about how many sermons had been written there. The last clergyman alone had written nearly three thousand, not to mention those he delivered without writing down. He must have often walked along the avenue, matching his thoughts to the sounds of the wind in the trees. I felt a bit ashamed of my career as a writer of stories, hoping that the wisdom in this house would inspire me to create something meaningful.

Behind the house was the perfect little study for a scholar. Emerson had written his essay ""Nature"" there when he lived at the Manse. The walls were once black with smoke and had portraits of stern Puritan ministers, which now seemed to have vanished, replaced by brighter colors and cheerful decorations. My books were few and not particularly special, but they were arranged around the room.

The study had three windows with old panes of glass. Two looked out onto the orchard and the river, while the third had a view of the river where a historic battle once took place. The clergyman watched the battle from that window, waiting in suspense for the gunfire.

The Concord River, which flows past the Manse, is a calm and gentle stream. It moves so slowly that it took me weeks to figure out which way it flowed. It’s a peaceful river, not one to be used for work or industry. It flows lazily, with lily pads and rushes along its banks, and the sight of it in the sunset is incredibly beautiful.

Let's take a walk along the river now, to where the old bridge stood, the site of the battle. On one side, there are elms that have grown since the battle day, and on the other side, we can see the remains of the old bridge. The river here is not very wide, just twenty swimming strokes across. There's a granite monument to remember the battle, though it's small and simple, fitting for a village's tribute.

There's also a grave for two British soldiers who died in the skirmish, buried by locals. They were the first of many to die in the Revolution. Lowell, the poet, once told me a story about a local boy who, during the battle, left his work at the Manse to join the fight with an axe. The story goes that he struck a wounded British soldier with the axe, a tale that sticks with me.

Many visitors come to see the battle site in the summer, though the real interest lies in the land between the battlefield and the Old Manse. Long ago, an Indian village stood here, and you can still find arrowheads and other tools in the soil. Finding these artifacts brings the past to life, even as the modern world surrounds us.

The Old Manse itself is surrounded by an orchard planted by the last clergyman in his old age. People laughed at him for planting trees he might never see bear fruit, but he lived to enjoy many apples and even sold the surplus. It's nice to think of him walking among the trees, enjoying the fruits of his labor.

During my time at the Manse, I felt a deep connection to the land, enjoying the fruits and vegetables from the garden. I spent many hours tending to my garden, watching the plants grow, and feeling a sense of pride in what I had helped create. Even the beauty of the summer squashes, with their varied shapes, was a source of joy.

When the weather was nice, I spent as much time outside as possible, but rainy days kept me indoors. The rain could make everything seem gloomy, but the Old Manse had its own ways to make even rainy days interesting. The garret, full of old books and memories, was a place of wonder and reflection.

The Old Manse was not without its ghost stories, as many old houses are. Some said there was a ghostly figure that sighed or rustled papers, and a phantom maid who worked in the kitchen at night. These tales added a sense of mystery to the house.

In the garret, I found old books that had been passed down through generations. They were interesting not for their content but for their history and the stories they might tell. Yet, they reminded me of how quickly human creations fade, unlike the vivid memories captured in old newspapers and almanacs.

When the sun returned after a storm, everything seemed brighter and more hopeful. Friends would join me for fishing trips on the river, where we would enjoy the beauty of nature and the freedom it offered. The woods and river were places of peace and reflection, and they inspired deep conversations and thoughts.

As autumn approached, the world seemed to embrace us with a gentle warmth. The changing seasons brought a mix of joy and melancholy, as they reminded us of the passage of time. The Old Manse, with its history and connection to nature, was a place where one could find rest and peace away from the world.

Eventually, it became time to leave the Old Manse. Changes were happening around it, and I knew it was time to move on. As I left, I reflected on the stories and essays I had written there, inspired by the peaceful environment and my own thoughts.

Though my time at the Old Manse was over, the memories and the experiences I had there would always stay with me. The tales I wrote during my stay were like flowers that bloomed in the quiet moments of my life, and I hoped they would bring some enjoyment to those who read them.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story is an internal one, revolving around the narrator's struggle to reconcile his identity as a writer of fiction with the rich historical and spiritual legacy of the Old Manse. This house, steeped in the traditions and lives of clergymen, carries the weight of its past, filled with sermons and religious contemplation. The narrator grapples with feelings of inadequacy and a desire for his creative work to be meaningful within the context of such a historically and spiritually significant place.

Additionally, there is a broader thematic tension between the passage of time and the preservation of history and memory. The narrator reflects on the changes occurring around the Old Manse and the impact these changes have on his sense of connection to the place. The presence of artifacts from past eras, ghost stories, and the natural beauty surrounding the house serve as reminders of both the continuity and the transience of human experience.

Ultimately, the narrator's time at the Old Manse becomes a journey of self-discovery and reflection, as he seeks to draw inspiration from the setting while confronting the inevitable changes and his own need to move on. This internal journey is mirrored by the physical journey through the landscape and history surrounding the Old Manse, blending introspection with a deep appreciation for the natural and historical world.",You live in a house full of ghost stories and ancient sermons.

028.txt,"His head hurt a lot, but he was alive, and being alive meant he had to fight to stay that way.

That was the first thing he realized as he woke up. The next thing he noticed was that his helmet should have been broken when the rough landing threw him across the ship's control room. But it wasn't.

The third thing he realized was that Ferris's helmet had shattered into pieces, and Ferris was dead.

Red sand was pouring into the ship through a big hole in the side, trying to bury him before he could stand up. He managed to move with more strength than he thought he had, and checked his body for injuries. He only felt bruised. It was strange. Ferris was dead.

He had a feeling that there was more to do than just check his oxygen and food supply and walk away. He had just completed the first Earth-to-Mars flight, wrecked his ship, and his navigator was dead. The planet seemed empty, so he couldn't just walk away.

There was enough room for him to crawl through the hole in the ship's side—just a matter of crawling up the sand and out. It was that easy.

Then Johnny Love was on his feet again, and the red sand seemed to hold onto his heavy boots as if trying to keep him from leaving Ferris and the ship. But he kept walking away.

Even 140 million miles from the Sun, the daylight was bright and the red sand reflected it, hurting his eyes. The sky was too high, and the desert plain was too flat and silent. The only movement was from the thin Martian wind making patterns in the sand dunes.

Johnny Love stopped walking. Even with the lighter gravity, it was hard to keep moving. He looked back at the smoke rising from his wrecked ship. It looked like an evil, black tower.

How far had he walked? How long?

He turned away from the ship and kept moving, hearing laughter in his helmet. Here he was, Johnny Love—the first and last Martian! Using the last of his strength to keep going when there was no point, no direction, no hope.

Why not just turn off the oxygen now?

But he was too tired for panic. Men had died alone before. Alone, but never without hope. And here, there was no hope because there was no life. No man had ever lived where there was no life.

But he had come to see, and he was seeing. In the hours left to him, he would see what no man had seen in half a million years.

Harrison and Janes, or Lamson and Fowler, wouldn't be down for twenty days at the earliest. That was the plan. Twenty days, twenty years—it was all the same. Time meant nothing here.

He and Ferris first, then Harrison and Janes, then Lamson and Fowler, all at twenty-day intervals. If all landed safely, they'd follow Plan I, Condition Optimum. If only two crews landed, Plan II, Condition Limited. And if only one made the trip, Plan III, Condition Untenable, Return.

That twenty-day gap idea came from someone on Earth who probably never set foot in a space operations room. Someone who thought carrying eggs in separate baskets was safer. Common sense said if something went wrong with Mars-I, it wouldn't happen to II and III at the same time.

Space wasn't common or sensible. It didn't follow the rules men made.

He kept walking, seeing, thinking, and breathing.

For a long time. He fell once or twice but got up to walk more, and then he fell a final time and didn't get up. Red sand whispered over him, dancing lightly, drifting...

A flat, wide vehicle swerved, kicking up clouds of red sand as it moved quickly across the desert. Its engines roared as it sped like a shiny dot drawn by a magnet. Behind it rose a thin trail of black smoke, and in its tracks were footprints already being covered by sand. The footprints got deeper as the vehicle raced ahead, and then they ended, and the vehicle stopped.

There was a mound of sand that the wind hadn't made by itself. The figures seemed to know that right away.

With quick moves, they flattened the mound and found Johnny Love. They took him into their vehicle and refilled the gas mixture in his tanks.

Then they drove away with him.

""Ferris?""

""Ferris was your navigator. He died when you crashed.""

""Harrison... Janes?""

""Harrison and Janes aren't due for nine more days. But you're safe.""

There was darkness and warmth; his throat was dry and hurt. It was hard to talk, and Ferris was dead. Harrison and Janes weren't due for nine more days. Someone said so. Nine more days and then everything would be—

Panic shook him, blood rushed to his head, and he was suddenly awake, sitting up.

""But Lamson, you were twenty days behind—"" The thought froze in his mind. Then a flood of memories buried it, and the red desert rushed up to swallow him. He screamed and fell back, hands clawing at his eyes.

""You're safe. You thought our planet was lifeless; that was a mistake. We live underground, Johnny Love. That's why you didn't see us or any signs of us. Some of us speak your language because we've been studying your brain and thoughts for eleven days.""

Johnny sat up again, eyes wide, hands ready to strike.

But he was alone in a small, clean room, and his muscles were useless. He tried to balance, but the low gravity confused him, and he crashed into a wall. A padded wall!

He got up, stood still, and looked around. There it was—above the cot. A small, round, shuttered opening—a two-way communication system. He wondered if they could see him, too. If they could, it only worked one way.

""Okay, whoever you are, you've studied me!"" He needed to direct his sudden anger at something, so he shouted at the opening. ""Now what....""

There was silence for a long moment, and he felt them studying him, like a scientist would study an animal. The feeling made him angry and question everything he believed about humans being more than animals.

He'd been wrong....

""Damn you! What are you going to do to me?""

He heard a gentle hissing but didn't pay attention. He needed to break the fear, make them tell him....

His muscles grew heavy, and his face burned with effort. His eyes stung. Something—like roses. But there were no roses on dead planets—

""Earthman, can you still hear?""

""I can hear,"" Johnny said. It was suddenly easier to talk. Even easier to understand. They had done something....

""We're surprised your shock wasn't worse. In studying you, we found that you were unprepared for Space-flight, and so—""

""Unprepared? What do you think all those months of physical training were for? Yeah, and all those textbooks? You think that ship I wrecked was built by kids—""

""Space-flight requires little of those things, Earthman. Most important is being prepared mentally and philosophically.""

""For what?""

""For everything unreal. Because they are the most real; infinity applies more to probability and possibility than to simple Space and Time. But—are you calm now?"" The voice grew deeper, almost friendly. Johnny tested his muscles; they weren't paralyzed—he could move, and his head was clear. No anger, no ""shock.""

""Go ahead,"" he said.

""Our study of you shows your race is strong and can survive. We think, with help, your race could be a great friend and ally. In short, we welcome you, Earthman. Will you accept us as friends?""

Johnny tried to think. What kind of game was this? What did they really want?

His lips were dry, but the words came easily. ""Who says you're a friend?""

""We could've learned about you by examining your dead body, Earthman.""

So he was alive, and that had to mean something. It might have been hard to keep him alive. The problem was you couldn't know anything when thrown into the impossible. The back of his neck felt cold.

But who offered their hand like this?

Whoever did anything like that?

No.

""We want to help you, Earthman, and your race. We've watched your kind, but never landed among you because of fear. But with help, there need be no fear. We offer you friendship and progress.""

""You keep talking about what we get."" Johnny looked upward, away from the opening. He wished he had a cigarette. ""You sound too much like a politician.""

""Perhaps you should know your ship is repaired and ready for your return to Earth anytime.""

""So, it's—You said Harrison and Janes would arrive in nine days! That means I've been out for almost two weeks! That's a long time to sleep, but nobody could fix that ship in eleven days! Not after what happened—""

""Your ship is repaired, Earthman.""

Johnny knew somehow the voice wasn't lying. Maybe miracles happened off Earth. He just didn't know enough.

""We want to give you information to take back to Earth that will end disease for you—all disease. Information that will give you spacecraft like ours. Information that makes you masters of your world. We offer you the stars, Earthman.""

He shut out racing thoughts. ""Maybe I'll believe this story of yours on one condition,"" Johnny said, ""because I can't do otherwise.""

""And that—condition?""

""Tell me why.""

There was a pause, and it felt like something unknowable hung in the silence.

""Picture, if you can, Earthman,"" came the answer, ""small islands in a big sea; all lifeless, but two. The men on one learned to build boats to sail the sea within limits—they visit other islands but can't go past the horizon. It's frustrating. They can only visit dead places. Except one—and it becomes their reason for being. Without it, their boats are useless....

""We're old, Earthman. We've watched you—waited for you. And now you've grown. You've broken free from your tiny world. You've set out on the sea yourselves....""

""You should give graduation talks. I didn't ask for a philosophy lesson. You tell me you want to give us everything—for free, no questions asked. So I asked why. And the question isn't changing.""

""The answer should be obvious, Earthman. We're old. And we're lonely.""

There was a logic at work even during the dream. It told him he was exhausted from the tour with the Martians, and the dream was just his tired mind. It said the things he'd seen were too strange for his Earth mind to accept without a reaction, and this was the reaction.

This, the dream. That's all it was; logic said so.

The dream showed Earth as it should be, with fertile plains, golden fruits, and beautiful cities. Men had done this, as though sanity had invaded their minds overnight.

The sun dimmed. The air chilled, and the crops wilted. The cities turned to skeletons under a dark sky. The horizon split into flames, and Earth became what men feared they'd create....

Then Johnny Love was awake, sitting up, eyes wide, muscles tight. He was afraid, though the Martians had offered friendship and said there was nothing to fear.

Slowly, he lay down again. The sweat that covered him vanished; his body relaxed, and the fear subsided.

The day's tour was exhausting, and he was excited knowing Harrison and Janes would land in five days. If they didn't, his ship would take him back to Earth the next day. The Martians had fixed it; they showed him. They showed him, and he wanted to go home.

Johnny Love rolled over, sighed, and went back to sleep.

""He sleeps again, Andruul.""

""Yes, but the damage may be done.""

""No, or he wouldn't sleep again so easily. His kind don't have such control.""

The two turned from the wall of the sleeping-room and walked down the metal corridor.

""Psychoanalysis showed his brain structure's difference—that's why our screens aren't working well. What does Kaarn say?""

""He says we shouldn't have let the theft happen.""

Andruul cursed. ""Allowed it! Those nomadic scum are like flies! No matter how many you kill, they return in greater numbers. And they strike when you're sure the last one is gone. Central Patrol has to get that unit back.""

""You're sure it was a theft, then?""

""Don't be stupid. When can those gypsies build anything more complex than a generator? Let alone a psibeam unit? They've forgotten what little their civilization knew.""

""They're clever at evading missiles.""

Andruul muttered and went silent.

""One thing's certain. A psibeam unit is missing, and even with our screens, the Earthman was disturbed in his sleep. His tapes show that clearly. They know about him, Andruul, and they're making their move. Central Patrol better act fast.""

Andruul kept quiet. But he thought Central Patrol was getting less efficient daily.

It was a strange feeling; one no human was ready for.

Johnny looked at his fixed ship, standing against the Martian sky, and then turned to the vehicles that had brought him back across the sand. Each step away from them closed the gap between him and his ship, leaving little time to think about the feeling. Or the heavy tube they gave him for his people.

Usually, when a man went beyond the familiar, there was conflict. A struggle to win or immediate success with no struggle.

But not this. Not this success that seemed—what was the word? Hostile? That was silly. These people were friendly. But somehow—there was an empty feeling—

He pulled it together. They saved his life. Fixed his ship. Gave him the tube with secrets his people might never learn. They even buried Ferris.

Use your brain, Johnny Love! You've done the most amazing thing without trying! Don't question things you don't get! Take the credit and forget the doubts!

He looked back again. They were still there. A special, smiling farewell escort, watching him walk to his ship.

He climbed up, hit the hatch button, and it opened.

He felt a chill at the back of his neck but ignored it. The lock pressurized, and he was inside, climbing to the control room.

He wasn't waiting for Harrison and Janes. He'd get home, then radio them and let them decide. He wanted to go home.

He strapped in, started the engines, and they came to life. The dials glowed, and he began a blast-off check. It took twelve minutes.

Then he was ready. Scanners on, heat up... ready.

The Martian sky was dark above him, and his hands were wet in his gloves. He felt dry in his throat. Now....

And he couldn't move. A sudden nausea hit, and his head spun. Before his eyes, he saw Earth bleeding, the sun dim, fertile plains in shadow. The air chilled, and skeletons reached for the leaden sky!

And Earth was no longer what Men had built!

Then the horror was gone, and he felt pressure on his head. His hands had been pressing his skull. His face was wet, and he was gasping for air.

A scanner alarm rang.

He focused on the screen.

""Earthman! Emergency! There's a flaw in your ship! Don't blast off! Don't....""

The other image caught him as his arm moved toward the controls. Sweet and warm... fertile plains under a mellow sun, cities beyond the hills.

But his arm kept going and hit the button.

The engines roared, and the ship lifted from the sand.

The command hit the Captain's brain like ice.

""Slaazar! Converge, sheaf!""

""Converging, sir...."" It was useless. If the brass had used beams instead of subtlety, the Earthman wouldn't have fallen for the Nomads. But they wanted to be forthright—force would arouse suspicion. Psibeam units only as a last resort.... The lowest Patrol Lancer could have told them that!

Slaazar ordered his crews to track the ship. But they'd see real psi-power now! Wasted completely....

""Convergence impossible, sir.""

As expected.

""Colonel Truul, this is Captain Slaazar. Target passed planetary curvature. Convergence impossible. Standing by, sir.""

For several moments, Mars's thin atmosphere warmed a little.

Acceleration blackout wasn't total; leaving Mars was easier than leaving Earth. But there was a time of no-thought, no-time, no-being. Then full consciousness returned. But it was wrong.

Johnny Love knew he was awake because he saw the glowing instruments. His ship was working perfectly. Almost ready to complete the blast-off curve, and—

He angrily switched off the scanners, and the red sphere faded.

And sweat started again. No, consciousness was all wrong.... And the image wouldn't leave....

The red desert he'd seen before, yet hadn't. Dark ridges of green at the horizon, odd craters that might have been lakes. No sign of Patrol tracks, no sign of anything.

But he had to go there.

He didn't know how to find it, but the image said to cut power.

His arms and hands felt weak, but they moved skillfully, playing across the controls.

Scanners on. Scanners on, kid....

He watched the screens, unconscious of his fingers on the panels. The red sphere loomed large. Off-center, he adjusted with the jets, centered again. But a different place. Still desert, but with green ridges, crater places....

It was coming fast, now; faster, until the horizon was an arc against blackness, and the rest cold red.

Without knowing, his fingers raced over the console before the alarms rang!

The ship jerked into a new direction, threatening to break apart, and the screen reeled. He knew his brain wasn't controlling his fingers; a human brain couldn't.

He'd cut power. No power. Falling at an angle, the desert rushing up. They hit him, yet nothing felt.

It was getting hot. His hull must glow, even in Mars's thin air—a long fall. Slower than Earth, through thin air, yet glowing like a torch.

The sand rushed up.

And his left hand hit the full-power button.

It was like being hit from behind with force, and two things. A crescent formation wheeled toward him, and the scanner-alarm rang. Two things he registered before the force of full power squeezed consciousness from him.

He was running. In a nightmare of a dead planet not dead, he ran, away from something.

That's how consciousness returned. While running. He stopped, stumbled, turned back.

And the ship was there. Landed perfectly, nose pointing skyward. And above it—

Run!

The command hit his brain like a physical force. A will not his own took hold, and he ran again, through the sand with strength from within.

Through his helmet, he heard his boots pounding below him, and another pounding, a pressure in his chest. A whine in his ears....

The sand stretched flat before him, then leaped, no horizon; just the sudden wrench of concussion, a tremor of sound which, in denser air, would destroy him.

He couldn't move. Only cling to the shifting desert floor, cling for dear life.

No thought, no understanding. Only sensation he couldn't comprehend, the end of survival.

Pain, and seeing two bright objects in the darkness; seeing something between.

His brain started identifying. The darkness; sky. The bright objects; Diemos, Phobos.... And something between—

It was a curved transparency; he'd not detect it otherwise. A vaulted ceiling through which he could see....

His full consciousness returned. He tried his neck muscles; they hurt but worked, and he could move his head. There was the same transparency, like an invisible bowl.

And there were men. Big, muscular, yet thin, tall.... Not like the others.

He sat up, and they didn't move. No small room. No voice unseen. They hadn't removed his suit or helmet, and he lay on a hard surface.

Then he saw what they did. Two apart from the others, moving a machine near him. A cylinder on gymbals between forks, on a wheeled stand. They aimed it at him.

""No! No—"" He tried to kneel, but it was like there were no muscles in his body.

""Man of Earth! We are friendly. Is that understood?""

The thought-words formed in his brain, and he knew. Should have guessed, part of his mind said, the dreams ... the compulsions he had no control over. This—thing.

""You are astute, Earthman. But we didn't create this device. To save you and your civilization—and ours—we had to steal it. It cost six lives.""

""Steal....""

""From your former captors. It is their invention, as are many things they destroy with. With this, they take psychokinesis and amplify it a million-fold. Energies projected in a beam.

""They can make a man 'dream,' or destroy him, depending on which 'psi' factors, ESP or PK, dominate during projection. But we're not skilled in its use—they detected our use on you while you slept, and we couldn't project enough power to touch your brain—""

There was a calm in his mind. He understood and accepted the words. They manipulated him, but it wasn't malevolent. Convinced. The conviction—manipulation, too.

""Only partly, Earthman. We said we're friendly, and we are. We calmed you and erased fear. From now, we use this for communication.""

And then he felt fear again, gnawing, his body cold. But he had control, enough to speak.

They stood, watching.

Somewhere, Johnny Love found his voice.

""Look, I've been through this 'friendly' thing before...."" He hesitated, they didn't interrupt. ""Well don't just stand there!"" Fear turned to bitter anger, he was tired. ""Tell me why! You put that thing in my head when I'm heading home. You force me back. You blow up my ship. Real friendly! Real sports!"" He paused, they didn't answer. ""Alright! I don't understand you—I don't know what you want. But nobody's trying to hurt you, nobody's after your desert paradise. We had an idea, that's all. We thought we could make it work. People talked 'go to Mars' on my planet for longer than most remember. So we finally tried! Sorry!""

He looked hard at them, and thought one almost smiled. Smile, then, damn you.

""We want nothing, Earthman, but to prevent what happened here from happening on your planet. If they destroy you as they did us, this System will always be under their heel, and we'll never be rid of them. Understand, their numbers were too few to conquer a planet with a large civilization like Earth's, by force.

""Knowing that, they call us gypsies, nomads, desert-scum today—weren't too alarmed when they landed two centuries ago. We were glad to take from them, without paying a price. We were awed by their gifts. Their books, which showed how to rebuild our civilization—advance us a thousand years in less than fifty; restore lost arts.... Compared to you, we were very few.

""In return, they only wanted to set up a research site. They said they were a scientific expedition from far out-System. Aldeberan, they said. Part of exploration they've done for centuries.

""We believed them—why not? One day, we thought, we'd be in Space. With that day, one of the greatest exploration projects known would begin. So we agreed, gladly.""

""Hold it, hold it! 'They'—who are 'they'? You can spare the suspense.""

And then no more words. The pictures formed in his mind, stronger now, no details left out.

The weapons were built by their hosts. The plans weren't too hard to follow.

The new knowledge wasn't hoarded, wasn't guarded by those who gave it, but by those who received it. One man from another; one group from another. States and nations from each other.

Until no trust was left on the planet.

Then the wars.

And when over, new masters had their first stronghold in the System.

""But, it was only a stronghold, and only intended as such—"" The pictures broke; words resumed. ""Your planet was the target, but at first, your civilization wasn't advanced enough to fall to their technique. Their weapon is knowledge, but its potential must be understood by a people before it can destroy them.

""The rest is clear. After we destroyed ourselves, they rooted here. From then, they investigated your Earth... and waited....

""Waited, because they knew you'd come. They knew what kind of men you'd be. Strong, with stars in your eyes. Yet confused, weak, with suspicion and jealousy in your souls. Such are humans....

""That's why we stopped you, Johnny Love. Once your blast-off curve took you beyond their horizon and over us, our psibeam was effective and theirs weren't. Sorry about your ship. Once they knew you were under our influence, and returning instead of taking their data to your people, they targeted with guided missiles—""

""It wasn't you, then. You mean they—""

""They can do much. Destruction is their strength. They couldn't stop us from preventing your taking their 'gift' to your people, but they could stop that 'gift' from reaching us—they did. They don't always win. But they never lose.""

""But I—"" Johnny's thoughts raced. The ship, gone. And Harrison and Janes, Lamson, and Fowler. They'd land in days.

""Yes,"" the thoughts of the real Martians answered. ""And they'll get a 'gift' for Terra as you did. If they return with that 'gift'—then—""

The thought wasn't finished. It didn't need to be.

A stronghold was one thing. These scattered people who once ruled Mars might unseat it, for they weren't beaten, and their will to survive was strong. But beyond—

Earth taken, the System taken.

There it was.

A coldness inside him now that the fact was real. Here was no fantasy; no wild guess.

They left him in silence, their psibeam turned away.

Harrison and Janes. Lamson and Fowler. Had to stop them. Stop them, then get home. He ached for home.

He thought of Ferris, who died for this.

No, Ferris wouldn't go home. Ferris was dead.

He signaled for the psibeam again.

""You'd need to know their positions to make contact, wouldn't you?"" They didn't answer. He worked to form words, a fleeting thought of a green, lush planet far away, its streets and fields in sunlight. ""I can figure 'em,"" he said. ""I know schedules, speeds. I know the works! Those were in the books. Then you guys can do the rest with—that. Right?""

They answered him.

""Thank you,"" they said. And that was all.

""Answer me!"" the General barked. ""You, Janes! Lamson! Fowler—Harrison! For the last time, what happened out there?""

The four stood before their commander, and Fowler spoke.

""Plan III, sir, as we've said. Condition Untenable—Return....""

""That's all you can say?""

""That is—all, sir.""

The General turned away. Frustration and anger hid the fear. Plan III. It would be Plan III for a while.

It was the thing he saw in the four men's faces that told him. Too many steps, too fast. He'd seen it before, but never so clearly.

One day, maybe, Plan I again. One day, not now.

He turned back to the four, looked into their faces.

Plan III. Condition Untenable.

""Dismissed!"" the General said.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Johnny Love's struggle for survival and understanding on Mars, amidst a backdrop of interplanetary intrigue and deception. Initially, Johnny faces the immediate dilemma of surviving the crash landing on Mars, where his navigator, Ferris, is killed, and he is seemingly left alone on a planet believed to be lifeless. However, the conflict deepens as Johnny encounters the Martian inhabitants who have been observing him, revealing that Mars is not lifeless after all.

The core dilemma evolves into a psychological and existential struggle as Johnny grapples with the intentions of the Martians, who offer friendship and advanced knowledge to Earth. He must discern whether their offer is genuine or if there are ulterior motives, especially given the revelation of another, more sinister group that previously manipulated the Martians, leading to their downfall.

Johnny's internal conflict is compounded by the notion of responsibility—his duty to prevent the same fate from befalling Earth, as the Martians warn of the dangers posed by the other group. The narrative tension heightens as Johnny must decide whether to trust the Martians and how to act upon the knowledge he has gained, all while dealing with his own skepticism and the fear of the unknown.

Ultimately, the story poses questions about trust, the potential for collaboration between species, and the ethical implications of sharing or withholding knowledge. Johnny's journey reflects a broader conflict between exploration and exploitation, highlighting the risks and responsibilities inherent in reaching beyond one's own world.",What if the only way to save Earth was to trust aliens who might be lying?,"Stranded on Mars, you discover a hidden civilization.

030.txt,"The planet was hiding itself.

From afar, it looked like a dull yellow eye. As we got closer, it seemed scarred and sinister. Beyond the circle where our landing-jets had burned the ground, it was covered in dark, hairy tentacles and big, sickly yellow flowers. These hid the mystery of its strange life forms.

On most planets we explore, life forms are somewhat similar to those on Earth. They have DNA that carries genetic messages in a way that's familiar to us. This DNA helps create different parts of the organism, like roots or wings, and passes these traits down through generations.

But here, even the genes were different—much more complex. The simplest plants had more DNA than anything we’d seen before. What message did these genes carry?

We were there to find out, using our new genetic micro-probe. This was a tool designed to study and even change the smallest parts of living things. It could help us understand these strange genes.

That was our mission.

We were the seventh ship to come to this planet. Six ships before us had disappeared without a trace. Our job was to discover why.

Our pilot was Lance Llandark. He was a tough, quiet man, as cold and serious as our micro-probe. We didn’t like him much—until we learned why he had volunteered for this mission.

His wife had been the pilot of the ship before ours. Once we knew that, we began to hear the hidden pain in his voice, as he kept calling out, “Come in, Six... Come in, Six...”

But Six never answered.

For two days, we watched the planet. We saw the trench our jets had made, the burnt tree stumps, and the jungle beyond. This jungle was the visible part of the planet’s strange genes—wild, dark, and completely alien.

On the third day, Lance Llandark took two of us out in a helicopter. We flew over the area, mapping six shallow craters where our ships must have landed.

We landed in the newest crater, where blackened stumps stuck out of the red earth like broken teeth. A yellowish stream oozed across the ground. By the stream, we found a human skeleton.

A weird plant stood next to the bones. Its thick leaves were streaked and twisted, half thorny and half sickly flowers. Rotten fruit blobs were falling onto the bones.

Lance Llandark stood up.

“It’s her turquoise thunderbird,” he said, showing us a piece of blackened silver and blue stone. “Back on Earth... when we were training to be pilots... we bought it from an Indian in an old town called Santa Fe.”

He bent down again.

“Lilith?” he whispered. “Lilith, what killed you?”

We found no other bones, and nothing to tell us why the jungle stayed back from that strange plant. We left at dusk. Lance Llandark carefully gathered the bones. We also took some leaves and dried pods from the plant. We found no other clues.

Day after day, we searched the other landing sites. We found jet marks, stumps, and wild plants, but nothing like the strange plant we found by Lilith Llandark’s bones. We found no wreckage, no sign of what had happened to the other missions.

Every day, the unknown mystery stared at us, lurking in the planet’s genes. Everything was plant life. We saw no animals, heard no cries or insect sounds. The silence was suffocating.

Day after desperate day, we returned to the micro-probe.

“The answer’s in the genes,” Lance Llandark said grimly. “It’s our only chance.”

He focused the probe on the strangest genes of all—those from the plant by his wife’s bones. They were unlike anything else on the planet. The DNA chains were incredibly long, and many of the links had copper or arsenic atoms.

“Strange!” Lance muttered. “No copper or arsenic in other plants here. I want to know why.”

He was working when we heard a woman scream. In that eerie silence, her scream shook us all. We rushed to the airlock.

Covered in tattered clothes and stained with red juices, she stumbled through the tangled vines. She fell in the mud, waving a rag.

Lance Llandark led three of us to help her. She looked up, tears streaking her dirty face.

“Lance!” she gasped. “My dear.”

“Lilith—” But he stepped back. “I found Lilith dead!”

“I’m nearly dead,” she said weakly. “We’re all stuck out there in the jungle. Emergency landing wrecked our navigation gear. Need your spare astro-pilot—”

“Back!” Lance shouted at us. “Back to the ship!”

“What’s wrong?” we asked, confused. “She’s your wife—”

“Aboard! Now!”

We obeyed his urgent voice.

“Help—” she whispered from the mud. “Survivors—need astro-pilot—to find our way home—”

The lock closed, cutting off her voice.

Angrily, we turned to Lance Llandark.

“Hold it!” he said. “I’m not crazy—the planet is. Come to the micro-probe. I’m studying a seed from the plant by Lilith’s bones. It puzzled me. So much of it was—”

Even with the tension, he had to search for the right word.

“Arbitrary! Those misshaped leaves, twisted stalk, sterile seed. The copper and arsenic in those useless links. Too many genes had no purpose. No use at all!

“I just figured it out, when that thing screamed. The copper and arsenic atoms aren’t instructions for the plant. They’re a message to us—words repeated a trillion times, hidden in every cell of the plant!”

“Words?” someone asked in disbelief. “Words in the atoms?”

“Written in binary code.” He looked triumphantly grim. “That plant’s a mutant. The real Lilith made the first cell with her micro-probe. She left it—inside her own body, I think—as a message that no fake Lilith could read.”

Outside, something screamed again.

“Call each copper atom a dot,” he whispered. “Each arsenic a dash. In order along the DNA chains, they spell out a message. The computer’s decoding it now.”

He pressed a button, and the printer whirred.

TO WHOEVER COMES... GIVE NO AID TO ANYONE... GET OFF THIS PLANET... ITS LIFE IS PSEUDOMORPHIC... DON’T LET IT LEAVE... JUST TAKE MY LOVE TO LANCE LLANDARK... FROM LILITH, HIS WIFE... AND GET OFF THIS PLANET, FAST...

Outside, it let out a frantic, bubbling scream.

We did get off the planet, and we plan to stay away.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of previous exploration missions to a strange, alien planet, and the subsequent mission's struggle to uncover the truth behind these vanishings. The dilemma deepens with the discovery of a human skeleton, the strange plant life that seems to hold secrets within its complex genetic code, and the eerie encounter with a figure claiming to be the pilot's supposedly deceased wife.

The story's tension arises from the exploration team's need to decipher the planet's genetic mysteries, particularly the message hidden within the DNA of the plant near the skeleton, which ultimately reveals a warning. This message is crucial because it represents a desperate plea from the real Lilith to prevent the planet's life forms—capable of creating deceptive imitations of humans—from spreading beyond the planet.

The conflict is further compounded by the emotional turmoil of Lance Llandark, the pilot, who is driven by his personal loss and the hope of finding his missing wife.

031.txt,"There are certain rare people in this world who seem to lack all common sense. These are the people who see a goal and then ignore intelligence, logic, good advice, and impossible problems. We might think these people are just plain foolish. What they want to do just can't be done. Their goals seem impossible, and anyone with a bit of sense can tell them so and give them good reasons why. They usually end up in bad situations and sometimes in trouble. But sometimes, they go out and discover new worlds.

Joshua Lake hadn't done any work that morning. He spent most of the time walking back and forth in his small office and the rest of it looking out the window, with his hands behind his back, staring at the clear sky.

At ten-forty, his office phone buzzed. He turned it on.

""Yes?""

""I have those numbers for you, Mr. Lake. We have nine—""

""Maybe you should come in and tell me in person, Lucy.""

""All right, Mr. Lake.""

The phone clicked off, and a few moments later, a young woman entered the office. Lucy Crane was a small, prim woman with a bun of black hair on her head. Joshua Lake always thought her bun showed disapproval. ""Sit down, Lucy. You use up too much energy.""

""I try to do my job, Mr. Lake.""

""You do that—and more. What are the numbers, Lucy?""

""We're in bad shape. We have nine thousand, four hundred and twenty dollars in the payroll account. That's over five thousand short. There's only about two thousand in General Disbursements, but that's not enough to cover bills due tomorrow. I'm afraid—""

""Don't be afraid, Lucy. That's negative. If we waste time worrying, we won't make any progress.""

""I didn't mean it that way, Mr. Lake. I'm not worried. I was just saying we don't have enough money.""

""Then I'll go to the bank and get some more.""

""Of course, Mr. Lake. Is that all?""

""Yes, that's all, Lucy. You can go to lunch.""

""You're not going out?""

""No. I'm not hungry today.""

Her bun bobbed as she left. Joshua Lake looked at the closed door and sighed. Lucy knew how things were. She wasn't easy to fool. But Joshua hoped the rest of the staff didn't realize. The engineers and draftsmen could all leave and find work elsewhere quickly, given the high demand.

He walked back to the window, feeling old and tired, with the weight of his sixty-odd years heavy on his shoulders.

""Then I'll go to the bank and get some more."" He knew he wasn't even fooling himself. His chances at the bank were none. His very presence there could make things worse. Loans could be called back, and the doors locked before night.

At the window, he looked down at the gate leading into the company's buildings and the big hangar where important work was happening.

A man and his dream, Lake thought.

He could only see the back of the sign over the gate, but he knew what it said: _Lake Interstellar Enterprises_ in bold letters; and in the corner—barely visible—_Joshua Lake—President_.

A visitor looking at the sign closely could see it had been painted over—an old name was still faintly visible underneath: _Lake and Gorman—Castings and Extrusions_.

It wasn't hard for Joshua to imagine Lee Gorman's rough, angry face. Or his words. Lee had a voice like gravel. A voice to remember....

""Of course I won't go along with this crazy idea of yours! Turn a good business into a fantasy factory? You've gone insane, Joshua.""

""But it's possible, Lee! We just need some imagination. I've hired the best minds. A rocket can be built that will take three men to the Moon and bring them back!""

""That's nonsense, Joshua!""

""Don't you think it can be done?""

""I don't care if it can be done or not!""

""But open your eyes, man! This is a time of progress. We're on the edge of the big tomorrow, and we can't let it pass us by! We can't let others get the glory while we just watch! Come alive, Lee! The world is moving ahead!""

""I don't want glory. I just want a good business. Suppose we could send a rocket to the Moon and back? We'd be broke, famous, and probably laughed at.""

""Not at all. We could control the gateway to the greatest mineral resources within reach! Think about it, Lee. Use your imagination.""

""I'm not going with you, Joshua. That's it.""

More of the same; days of it, and finally: ""You can have the customers then, Lee. I'll keep the plant—the physical properties.""

""But that's not fair.""

""Maybe not, but it's legal.""

""How can I serve them—from my basement?""

""I offered you a choice only a fool would refuse—""

""That only a fool would accept!""

""—so now I'm going ahead and nothing can stop me. I've got a dream, Lee—a dream of a big tomorrow. I'm going to make it come true.""

""Call it right, Joshua. You've got an obsession.""

The end of _Lake and Gorman_....

Joshua turned from the window and looked again into the sky. The Moon was up, a round, white shape in the clear blue afternoon sky. He stared at it, and a feeling of connection swept over him, stronger than ever. The Moon was both a goal and a comfort. Seeing it always cleared his doubts and lifted his spirits.

The intercom buzzed. Joshua went over and turned it on. ""Yes?""

""Mr. Coving to see you, sir.""

""Send him in.""

Rayburn Coving was probably the best rocket-fuel man in the world. He had a little sandy hair left, not much, and his forehead was permanently creased from frowning. ""I'm afraid that new fuel mix is a failure, Chief. It builds up corrosion in the tubes too fast. They'd clog halfway through the trip.""

One hundred and twenty thousand dollars wasted. Joshua sighed. ""Well, the chance of success was worth it. The added power in smaller space would have solved many problems.""

""I'm sorry it failed.""

Joshua smiled. ""As an American inventor once said, we're finding many ways you can't go to the Moon. What now, Coving?""

""Back to the old method—and the other problems. None are impossible, though. A little more time—""

""Yes—a little more time."" Joshua grimaced inside. He was talking as if they had years—not as though their time had run out. He was even in debt for Coving's work; overdrawn without enough money to pay.

The moment of weakness, of deep-down tiredness, passed. Joshua Lake straightened as he had so many times before. As he had when Zornoff's alloys failed and the first trip to the bank was needed. The first trip to the bank. Joshua smiled wryly. The bank people had been friendly then. Later it had been different. Now—

""You were saying, Mr. Lake—?""

""Have you seen Morton lately? What's the latest on the radar relay equipment?""

""No major problems, I think. It's coming along well.""

""Good!"" For two hundred thousand it certainly should, Joshua felt. ""Let me know how you make out, Coving.""

""I will, Chief. I'll get the order in for the new chemicals immediately.""

""Eh—oh, yes. Do that. Do that by all means.""

Coving left. Joshua Lake leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. He dozed, drifting into a haze from tiredness. _It's been so long—so very long. Seven years—eight—ten. Ten years. Was it possible? It didn't seem that long. Ten years to make a dream succeed._

_Or fail._

Joshua slept, and again—his rest was plagued with visions. The torment of his days took many forms in an alert mind too tense to relax. He had seen before him mountains too steep to cross—chasms too deep and wide to bridge. Often, when a great problem was solved, he would look back, nights later, to see the mountain or the chasm from the other side.

Now his vision was different. No mountain before him, but a face—the stern rough face of an obstacle in his path.

Lee Gorman.

The face was of clay—yet it lived. The eyes were cold, disdainful. And a weird, green creation of Joshua's own mind was sketching Gorman in the numbers, signs, and symbols of a rocket that would never reach the Moon.

Joshua awoke with a start and found Lucy bending over him. ""You didn't answer the buzzer, Mr. Lake. I was worried.""

""I must have dozed off, Lucy. Sorry.""

""I'm going home now—if there's nothing else.""

""Nothing else. I'm going home myself. Good night.""

Joshua paused beside his car in the parking lot to stare at the lighted windows of the big hangar. The second shift had come on. They would work all night; then, tomorrow, they would line up with the others at the pay window. But there wouldn't be any money. The next night the hangar windows would be dark.

He got into the car and drove home.

Myra was waiting for him. She took his hat. After he kissed her, she said, ""Your eyes are red, dear. You've been working much too hard. Shall we have dinner in the patio?""

""That would be nice.""

Joshua had little to say during the meal, and Myra was quiet also—adjusting herself, as she had always done, to his mood. Finally, she said, ""That will be all, Bertha. Leave the coffee pot.""

The maid left. A slight chill was coming in off the desert. Joshua shivered and said, ""We're through, Myra.""

""Through? I don't understand.""

""The Moon trip. I can't manage it. The money's run out. There's no place I can raise another dime.""

""But you've worked so hard—and so long! And you are so close to success.""

""We've made a lot of progress, but the rocket isn't ready yet. Now it's too late.""

They were silent for a time. Then Myra said, ""In a way, I'm glad. You should have stopped long ago. You aren't strong enough to stand this pace forever. Now we can go away—get a small place somewhere. That Moon rocket was killing you, Joshua.""

Joshua thought about it. ""Killing me? No, I don't think so. I think it has been keeping me alive.""

""Don't say that, dear! You make it sound so—so brutal! Year in and year out. Fighting disappointment—failure. Aging before my eyes while I sit here night after night!""

_Fighting disappointment—failure._ Yes. That was the kind of fight it had been. How many failures? The first big one had come six years before....

""Acceleration, Monsieur, must be achieved in the first two thousand miles of flight. After that, the speed of the ship remains constant. You follow me?"" Tardeau, the half-mad French genius had explained it so logically. And Joshua had believed in him. That's where you made your big gamble in a project of this kind. You selected your men and then believed in them. Others disagreed, of course. There are always dissenters. And always points that could not be proven or disproven on the drawing boards or in the test pits....

""I follow you, Henri. The booster units will be in three sections.""

""Exactly, Monsieur. The primary—ah, booster, as you say, breaks free at twelve miles. That one, and the secondary, we control with radar. We touch a button and Voila! they are free!""

""In case the men in the ship black out, I think you said.""

""Exactly. But the third will be disengaged from within the ship and she will be free as a bird to fly to your most illusive Moon!""

""And the return?""

""There we have a much lighter ship, Monsieur. The smaller boosters will lift her easily. The return trip will be slower—much slower, but she will return!""

Michael Bernard was the dissenter. ""The Frenchman's crazy! Mad as a hatter, Chief.""

""You think it won't work, then?""

""Too darn complicated. A dozen units of time and mechanism have to mesh perfectly. The odds are against that happening. After all, you've got to remember, what we're attempting has never been done before.""

""But if it did work—?""

""It would be a beauty.""

""Better than your idea of a single booster?""

""If it worked—yes. The weight problem would be solved. Five men could ride the rocket. But—""

""Let's try it, Mike. Let's believe in our destiny.""

""Okay—you're the boss. But destiny's a hard thing to lay out and analyze on a drawing board.""

A man and his dream....

The radar equipment had failed. Burdened with the weight of exhausted booster sections, the rocket curved back into the clutches of gravity.

It crashed on the edge of the Amazon jungles.

Five Moon pioneers dead. Three uninsured, dependent families. Joshua provided for them, but the critical newspapers overlooked that point. One editorial observed that Joshua Lake would get a rocket to the Moon and back if it took every able-bodied man in the country. The project would have died right there if Joshua had needed money. No bank in the nation would have loaned him a dime. Fortunately he was not yet broke. He started over.

_Fortunately?_

At times he had wondered. But always, his faith had returned to buoy him up....

Joshua reached out and took Myra's hand. He looked up into the sky. ""You may be wrong, my dear. Possibly it's the other way. A man's ambition—"" he smiled. ""Lee called it an obsession once. A man's dream can keep him alive.""

""But why does it have to be so hard? Why can't one of the big corporations help you? They'll profit from your success!""

""At least I had no competition in the fulfillment of my dream.""

They were silent for a time; then Myra said, ""But now you can rest. We'll go away. We don't need much money. We'll have a garden. You can lie in the sun.""

He laughed softly; not with humor; rather with a quiet, new courage. ""We're talking as though it were all over—finished, done with. That isn't right.""

She glanced at him quickly. ""But you just said—""

""I know. But I didn't really mean it that way. We aren't through yet.""

""You know where you can raise—more money?""

""I know where it is. I'm going to see Lee Gorman tomorrow.""

""Lee Gorman! You aren't serious.""

""There's no place else to go.""

""You'll be wasting your time, Joshua. He'll—he'll humiliate you.""

""He probably will. And I may not get the money. But there's no place else to go.""

Tears came into Myra's eyes. ""Don't do it, Joshua. Please don't do it.""

""It won't be as bad as you think, dear. I guess Lee is entitled to crow a little.""

Lee Gorman looked at the intercom on his desk as though it had snapped at him. ""Who?"" he barked. But there had been no mistake. Gorman sat in puzzled silence for a few moments. Then he said, ""All right, show him in.""

Joshua Lake entered the office with his hat in one hand and a briefcase in the other. He paused halfway to Gorman's desk. ""You haven't changed much, Lee.""

""You have,"" Gorman answered. ""You look like the devil.""

""I've been working hard."" Joshua Lake covered the distance and stood before the desk. Gorman looked at him coldly. Joshua looked around the office as Gorman sat silent, not inviting him to sit down.

""You've done very well, Lee. This is the first time I've seen your plant.""

""I've expanded a little since my basement days. You remember my basement days, don't you Joshua?""

Joshua winced. ""Yes, I remember.""

""And now you might tell me the purpose of this visit.""

""I came to you because I need money.""

Gorman's eyes snapped open—wide. He opened his mouth to speak. He failed, tightened his throat, and tried again. ""You came here after _what_?""

""Money. I'm broke, Lee. I haven't enough to meet my payroll.""

""You expect me to bail you out—clean up your debts—put you clear?""

""I came after more than that. Merely bailing me out wouldn't help a bit. I need three hundred thousand to put my rocket in the air.""

Gorman collapsed gently back into his chair like a balloon mercifully relieved of some of its content. When he spoke, it was with a slow, controlled anger. ""I've heard of guts, Joshua. I've heard of nerve—plain nerve. But this tops anything—why, man, you threw me out! You robbed me! You left me standing in the street with a bookful of names and addresses under my arm—nothing more. Now you come here and ask for money!""

""I'm glad you've done well, Lee. There was nothing personal in what I did. I'm glad you've gone on to even bigger things than we would have achieved together.""

""You're glad I've done well! Why, you pious hypocrite! I ought to have you thrown through the window instead of merely ordering you out!""

""There is no reason why I should expect any better treatment, Lee. But I had to come here. You were my last hope. I had to ask.""

Joshua turned slowly from the desk. He had taken but three steps when Lee Gorman said, ""Wait a minute. I'm curious. Are you _really_ still at it—beating your brains out against that stone wall?""

""It's my dream, Lee. I've got to be the first man to put a rocket on the moon.""

""But now you're broke—washed up. What's with the dream now?""

""I guess it's finished."" Joshua turned and took another step; but Gorman didn't want him to go.

""Tell me,"" Gorman said. ""What have you got in that briefcase?""

""Progress reports. Plans. I wanted to show them to you.""

Gorman grinned. ""All right. I've got a few minutes. Come and do it.""

Joshua Lake retraced his steps. He sat down in a chair next to Gorman's desk. He laid his hat on the desk and opened the case.

""No,"" Gorman said. ""Stand here by my elbow. The chair is for people I meet on even terms.""

Joshua got obediently to his feet and placed himself as directed.

""And your hat,"" Gorman added. ""You'd better hold that. You might forget it when you leave.""

""Of course, Lee.""

It was a pitiful sight but, withal, a grim note ran through the scene. Joshua supporting the case against his thigh, got out a stack of papers. ""These are the progress reports to date. These, the projected plans.""

""And when these plans are carried out you expect success?""

""Yes. Great foresight has been used. They will carry us through.""

""And you expect me to loan you money on the strength of this—this day-dreaming on paper?""

""It's far more than that, Lee. You'll find the plans sound.""

Lee Gorman didn't care for the plans. He was only enjoying an interview—a revenge—he was loath to end. ""You haven't even begun to show me what I'd need before I even considered loaning you a dime.""

""I'll bring you anything you want.""

""Even if I promise to turn you down after I've gone over it?""

""You're calling the shots, Lee.""

""All right—I'll call it. Bring me your payroll records; your cost sheets; the background reports on the key men in your organization.""

""As soon as I can get them. I need some money immediately to meet my payroll.""

""Then what are you waiting for?""

""I'll be back this afternoon."" Joshua was halfway out the door when Lee Gorman called. ""And bring the deeds to your plant—the bills of sale to your machinery and equipment.""

""Certainly.""

Joshua left, and Lee Gorman sat motionless staring at his desk. There was a mysterious smile on his rugged face.

""It's not worth it, Joshua,"" Myra said, hotly. ""You won't be able to take his bullying day after day. That's his intention. That's what he's giving you the money for—to humiliate you day after day.""

""Of course, my dear. I'm lucky that Lee is that kind of a man. He wants his revenge and he's willing to pay for it. I was hoping it would be that way—praying for it. It was my last weapon. The last weapon I had with which to reach the Moon.""

A man and his dream....

""I want you to sign these papers, Joshua."" Lee Gorman held out a pen and pushed the papers across the desk.

""Certainly, Lee.""

""Four copies.""

Joshua pushed the papers back, looked at them, and smiled.

""Do you know what you signed?""

""A power of attorney, I believe. And I've signed the plant over to you. There is a large mortgage against it, however.""

Lee Gorman sat back, narrowed his eyes as he looked at the small man with the giant dream. ""Joshua, I think you've worked beyond your time. You've lost it completely. Do you realize that with these papers I can put you in the street? That all I have to do is raise my hand and you're done?""

""I realize that, Lee.""

""Then why on earth did you sign them?""

""I had no choice.""

""But what kind of a choice is this? Giving away everything you've got?""

Joshua sighed. ""You haven't raised your hand yet, Lee. I can handle my problems only as I come to them. I'll think about that one when it gets here.""

""Well—I've got news for you. The time to think about it is—"" Gorman stopped mid-sentence. He studied Joshua Lake for a long minute. Then he took a checkbook from his desk and wrote rapidly. ""There's money to meet your payroll. The exact amount. Take it to the bank. Then, I want you in this office every day at four-thirty with a complete report of what's gone on. Don't overlook a thing. And bring any bills with you that need paying, together with material orders and projected costs. Is that clear?""

""I understand, Lee."" At the door, Joshua Lake turned for a moment. ""And—thank you—thank you very much.""

After Joshua had left, Lee Gorman pondered one of those last words. If they contained any bitterness, it was well hidden. ""A strange man,"" Gorman muttered. ""A very strange man.""

If that was a weak moment on the part of Lee Gorman, his defenses were repaired well in time to present a hostile front....

""This twelve thousand to American Chemical—what are you doing—running an experimental lab on the side? I won't pay it.""

""I've never questioned Coving's judgment in these matters, Lee. He's done brilliant work for us. The man has to have materials to work with.""

""Well, you certainly should have questioned him. He's been satisfying every whim of curiosity that pops into his mind. Send the stuff back.""

""But that would be fatal to the project. The fuel _must_ be power-charged to safely handle the weight and time issues. Coving can't work with salt and baking soda.""

""I don't care what he works with. Cut three thousand off that bill.""

""Very well, Lee.""

A man and his dream....

""This payroll's out of all reason. Cut fifteen men off immediately.""

""I'll see what I can do.""

""Cut fifteen men off immediately.""

""Of course.""

""Here's a check for the interest on the last note. Take it over to the bank.""

""Yes, Lee.""

Joshua Lake came and went as directed. He stood with his hat in his hand, took orders, carried them out. His shoulders drooped a little more; his face became more pinched; he retreated deeper and deeper into himself.

But as the days went on, his eyes brightened and there was a breathlessness in his expression when he turned his face to the sky.

Some three months after the day Joshua walked into Lee's office, the latter said, ""The four men who are going with the rocket. You've selected them?""

""Yes. They're waiting for the day. It was a long slow process, selecting the best men.""

""Bring them here tomorrow afternoon.""

""I'll check with them. If they all can't make it, would a later date—?""

""I said tomorrow. See to it they _can_ make it.""

""Yes, Lee.""

Joshua brought the four young men to Lee Gorman's office the next day. Lee had a buffet table set up. He was the smiling, genial, expansive host. ""Sit down, gentlemen. I'm glad of this opportunity to meet you.""

There were five chairs in the room. Gorman had already seated himself. The young men hesitated.

""Sit down, sit down.""

They dropped into the chairs, glancing uneasily at Joshua Lake. Joshua turned and started toward the door.

""Don't go, Lake. I'm sure the boys would like a drink. You'll find the fixings on the buffet. Why don't you take their orders?""

The crowning insult, Joshua wondered. The last, crude insult? Lee Gorman's wounds must have been deep indeed. Joshua served drinks, brought sandwiches. Lee Gorman's geniality kept the awkwardness of the situation from bringing it to a complete stop. ""Well, Thursday is the day, I understand. How do you feel about it? Rocketing off into space. Becoming a part of the big tomorrow."" Gorman's eyes caught those of Joshua Lake as he spoke the last sentence. There was laughter behind them.

The crew of the Moon rocket left shortly afterward. Joshua was the last to walk from the room. Just as he was going through the door, Lee Gorman whispered into his ear. ""You can't be sure there'll be a rocket flight. I might stop it the last minute. I haven't made up my mind yet.""

Joshua turned and looked at his tormentor in silence. The others had gone on down the hall. Gorman laughed and said, ""I suppose that's a problem you'll face when you come to it?""

""Yes—when I come to it.""

Alone in his office, Lee Gorman strode angrily to the buffet. With a sweep of his arm, he knocked a liquor bottle across the room. The motivation of the act was hard to determine, however, from Gorman's outward appearance. It could have been bitter disappointment or a fierce joy.

Joshua Lake walked into Lee Gorman's office, removed his hat and said, ""With your permission, this is the day.""

""What time?""

""It translates into 4:07 and 30 seconds, Greenwich time.""

Gorman frowned. ""I suppose you've arranged quite a party.""

""Nothing too big. We'll leave for the blasting pits at 3:00 o'clock. I'd be honored if you'd ride with me.""

""Do you still own a car?""

""A small one. Its value is negligible.""

""We'll go in one of mine. Be here at five minutes to three.""

""Certainly."" Joshua put his hat on and walked out....

They rode across the Nevada desert in a black Cadillac with the chauffeur sitting at attention and staring straight ahead. Joshua stared straight ahead also. He asked, ""Are you going to stop the flight?""

Beside him, leaning forward, clutching with both hands the silver knob on a black mahogany cane, Gorman replied, ""I haven't made up my mind yet.""

A dot on the desert expanded into a pit, a tower, and some small buildings. The car followed the ruts of the tractors that had hauled the rocket to the launching site, and came to a halt. ""That small, glass-encased platform,"" Joshua said. ""We'll view the proceedings from there.""

Gorman snorted. ""I'll view them from where I please.""

They were standing beside the car, Joshua slightly behind his benefactor. ""From the platform.""

Gorman frowned and half turned. ""What are you doing?""

""I'm holding a gun against your back. It is a very small gun. No one can see it and it probably wouldn't kill you. Then again, it might. We will walk to the platform and stand together to watch the blast-off.""

""You'd actually—_kill_, to get that ship into the air?""

""If I committed murder, I would certainly regret it the rest of my life, but the rocket must be launched.""

They stood in the glass enclosure on the platform and no one came near them. Several people veered close and waved. Joshua waved back with his free hand and the people went on their way.

An hour passed. There was vast activity on the field. Gorman said, ""I'm tired. I want to sit down.""

""It was thoughtless of me. I should have provided chairs. It won't be long now.""

It wasn't long. Five minutes later there was a roar, an explosion of color, and a silver rocket flashed up into the sky almost faster than the eye could follow.

Gorman slammed the heel of his hand against the side of his head to restore hearing. ""You can put that gun away.""

""Of course. And you'll want to call the police.""

Gorman growled like an annoyed bull. He jerked open the door and strode away.

Three hours later, Joshua and Myra Lake were seated in the small patio beside their home. They were seated very close together, and Myra was stroking Joshua's hand. ""It's been a long time, dear; a very long time.""

""Yes.""

""Are you happy?""

""I'm—well, satisfied—at least partially. We've passed a big milestone. But it isn't over yet.""

""You're sure this time, though?""

""Very sure.""

""Thank heaven we won't have much longer to wait.""

The wait was slightly less than ten minutes. Then Lee Gorman strode into the patio. Joshua sprang to his feet. ""Any news?""

""Yes.""

""Then they should have phoned me. I left word to be called.""

""No one could get up the courage. The rocket crashed in Canada.""

Joshua swayed. When he looked at Lee, his eyes were filled with a mute plea. ""That _is_ the truth?""

""It's the truth. The first report said it appears the tail broke off in high space.""

Joshua sank into his chair. ""The crew—died?""

""Four more men sacrificed to your—"" Gorman stopped and did not use the word _obsession_. There was too much agony in Joshua's face. ""I'm taking the plant—I'm taking everything. I've got to. I've paid for them.""

Lee Gorman walked from the patio. His steps echoed and died.

Joshua and Myra sat for a long time in silence. Myra was holding his hand. Finally she spoke. ""Well, at least it's over. Now you can rest. Successful or not—you've earned it.""

Joshua turned and looked into her face—looked at her as though she had just entered. ""Oh no, my dear. You certainly don't expect me to—""

""Joshua!""

""Why, I'm only sixty-three. I never felt better in my life. I have a lot of good productive years ahead.""

""_Joshua! What are you going to do?_""

""I'm going to be the first man to send a rocket to the Moon.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around Joshua Lake's unwavering determination to achieve his seemingly impossible dream of sending a rocket to the Moon, despite facing significant financial and personal obstacles. This conflict is both external and internal.

Externally, Joshua is up against the harsh realities of business: financial insolvency, skepticism from others, and the practical challenges of engineering a successful lunar mission. He is in a dire financial situation, with diminishing resources and mounting debts, which puts immense pressure on him and his company. His former business partner, Lee Gorman, represents an additional external obstacle, embodying skepticism and providing a potential source of funding that comes with the price of personal humiliation and loss of control over his company.

Internally, Joshua grapples with the tension between his dreams and the reality of his circumstances. His persistence and idealism push him forward, even as he faces repeated failures and the potential ruin of his life's work. This internal conflict is heightened by his awareness of the toll his obsession takes on himself and those around him, particularly his wife, Myra. Despite these challenges, Joshua's dream acts as both a source of motivation and a burden, driving him to continue his pursuit against all odds.

Ultimately, the story explores themes of ambition, perseverance, and the fine line between visionary dreams and obsession, leaving the reader to ponder the cost and value of pursuing one's dreams in the face of overwhelming adversity.",Imagine risking your entire company to send a rocket to the Moon.

032.txt,"Ellaby's society was a perfect democracy where all men were equal. But some still wanted more personal attention, and they got it, like--

* * * * *

Just looking at Ellaby, you could tell he was going places. He was five feet nine inches tall and weighed a hundred and fifty pounds. He had an I.Q. of ninety-eight point five-seven, just slightly below average. His hair was a dull color and was a bit long for a man, a bit short for a woman. Back in High Falls, where he was from, he wasn't the strongest guy around but was stronger than most women.

He had been training since he turned twenty to assassinate the Dictator. Now, Ellaby was thirty years old.

Dorcas Sinclair met Ellaby at the pneumo-station. She was big and strong for a woman, but not unattractive. Her hair was dull, her face was a bit rough, her chest was small, and her legs were heavy.

""I'll take your bags,"" she told Ellaby, and led him from the station. She walked fast but not too fast. You always had to find the right balance, Ellaby thought. For him, finding the middle ground was easy. When Ellaby graduated from High Falls secondary school, the words MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED were under his picture in the yearbook. Everyone expected it: Ellaby had learned his three R's--rules, rights, responsibilities--well. He wasn't great at anything, but he didn't fail either. He was a good citizen by nature.

Running to keep up with Dorcas Sinclair, who was carrying his suitcases, Ellaby looked at the Capitol. It stretched out in front of him in the bright summer sunlight, and he felt excited. His heart sped up, and he felt a rush of energy.

This was the city. It was here where Ellaby's life would change. Here, Ellaby, average Ellaby, would pass his tests for top-secret work. Here, in this city, Ellaby would kill the Dictator.

And after that--what? Chaos? A new order based on something else? Ellaby wasn't sure. No one in the organization knew for sure. The idea was huge and hard to understand. Well, let the others worry about it. They did the planning. Ellaby was only the one who would carry it out.

* * * * *

The house was like all the others on the block, a strong building made to look like brick. The street was straight and faded into the distance, crossing other streets at perfect right angles. The city was laid out in a grid pattern, making the best use of space for houses. Ellaby remembered from school that people in the city had the right to a room and bath as long as they were employed.

""You will have to live here with me,"" Dorcas Sinclair told Ellaby, ""until you pass your tests for employment. I don't have to tell you how much depends on the outcome of those tests, Ellaby.""

""But I can't fail them. I thought you knew my record.""

With unexpected force, Dorcas Sinclair's strong fingers gripped Ellaby's arm. ""Well, you had better not,"" she said.

Ellaby was suddenly worried. He wasn't used to people like this. They were as unpredictable as the weather in High Falls, which didn't have weather control because its population was too small. Unlike the average person, they hadn't been studied in detail. Their likes and dislikes weren't known, and their passions couldn't be predicted.

""Ease up, Dorcas,"" a deep voice said from the doorway leading to the kitchen.

Ellaby looked in that direction thankfully. It was uncomfortable for a woman, for anyone, to show emotions so openly. Ellaby almost wanted to thank the stranger.

""Stranger, nothing!"" Ellaby blurted aloud. His face turned red, and he apologized. ""I didn't mean to raise my voice,"" he explained. ""You surprised me.""

""I guess you didn't expect to find me here. You haven't changed much, Ellaby.""

Ellaby automatically mumbled his thanks for the compliment. Sam Mulden, though, had changed. He'd always been a bit different. His hair was cut too short. He was tall and thin, and his elbows and knees stuck out like knots on a tree. Mulden looked older. He hadn't bothered to dye his graying hair or smooth the wrinkles on his face. He was smiling at Ellaby now, as if he could read Ellaby's mind. ""I might have known it would be you,"" he said. ""As soon as they said the assassin was coming from High Falls, I should have guessed.""

""Why?"" asked Ellaby. It was a question he had wondered about for ten years. When people go out of their way to train you, to spend ten years teaching you everything about a place you've never been to, to make you good with weapons even if you're just average, to teach you things like democratic inequality and individuality, you don't question them.

""For two reasons,"" Mulden said. ""You can understand the first, Ellaby. If the second one bothers you, forget it. In the first place, you're so perfectly average, the government would never suspect you. In the second place, you're so well-adjusted you're bound to follow our instructions.""

""Or any instructions,"" Dorcas Sinclair said. ""That's what I'm afraid of, Mulden.""

* * * * *

Ellaby couldn't believe it. He never expected to find Sam Mulden in such a high position in the organization or anywhere. He remembered Mulden clearly from school. Mulden was a real character. Physically, he was barely acceptable: more than eighty percent of the men and some sixty-five percent of the women could knock Mulden down in gym class. But mentally, Mulden was a misfit. His I.Q. was around a hundred and fifty. His awkward body wasn't too far below average, but mentally he was far above it.

Now Mulden told Dorcas Sinclair, ""Don't worry about that. We've had ten years to work on him. They can't undo it in a few days. Ellaby, you are quite sure you know what you must do?""

""Oh, yes. Tomorrow morning I will take my security tests. According to the record of my previous testing, I should make top secret classification. I will work here in the capitol. I will find the Dictator and kill him. The only thing that bothers me is I don't know who to look for. What does the Dictator look like?""

""Didn't they explain all of that to you in High Falls?"" the woman asked irritably.

""Ease off,"" Mulden told her for the second time. ""He's confused. Listen to me, Ellaby. Don't you remember? The Dictator never makes public appearances.""

""Yes. Yes, now I remember. No one knows what the Dictator looks like. He keeps to himself. He issues orders that are instantly obeyed, helping to maintain equality in the country. It almost seems a shame I'll have to kill him.""

""So we've trained him for ten years, and he still questions it!"" Dorcas Sinclair raged. Ellaby turned away in embarrassment. ""Damn you, Mulden, he still questions it!""

""He's supposed to,"" Mulden explained quietly. ""If he accepted what we told him, he'd go around talking about it naively. This way, he understands the need for secrecy.""

""He doesn't understand--""

""Well, then he realizes it. Let him get some sleep, will you? Tomorrow's going to be a good day for us, a big day for him. Good night, Ellaby. If you want anything, Sinclair will get it for you.""

Ellaby assured them he would want nothing except a simple meal of whatever most people in the Capitol ate on Wednesdays. It turned out to be pork chops, which Ellaby neither particularly liked nor disliked. He ate his food without much enthusiasm and went to bed early.

* * * * *

The next morning, Ellaby took his I.Q. test at the Capitol personnel bureau. He was slightly above average in space perception but slightly below average in comparisons. He hoped his anxiety didn't show on his face. If anyone asked him why he had come to the Capitol, he was ready to blurt out the reason and be done with it. He wondered what Sam Mulden would have thought if he knew. The Sinclair woman would have been furious.

No one asked Ellaby. You came to the Capitol because you wanted to work there. According to the average, a man wanted to change his location every 3.7 years. Ellaby had been 6.3 years late, but High Falls was an ideally average community where people liked to stay.

""I.Q., point seven under the average,"" the personnel clerk told Ellaby. The slight variation--due to his anxiety--was not enough to matter, Ellaby realized with a faint sense of triumph. ""Proceed to physical testing,"" the girl told Ellaby.

Obediently, Ellaby followed the green arrow to the gymnasium. He was given a locker, a towel, a pair of athletic shorts, and a first-aid kit. He stripped off his clothing, placing his tunic, underwear, and sandals in the locker, then changed into his athletic shorts and joined the line of other men and women carrying their towels and first-aid kits into the gymnasium.

The male wrestling tester, who was ten-over-average, pinned Ellaby in less than two minutes, a fact which was noted on his employment blank. He was given fifteen minutes of rest, then squared off on the mat with a skinny, five-under-average male. Ellaby beat him in four minutes flat, took another fifteen-minute break, then defeated the ten-under-average female wrestler in two minutes and some seconds. It was a tough fight with the two-over-average female, who finally pinned Ellaby's shoulders to the mat for five seconds after half an hour.

Ellaby showered, ate a hot Thursday lunch, and took his employment blank to the emotion lab. His electroencephalogram showed nine alpha cycles per second, but too much theta.

""Are you nervous?"" the technician asked Ellaby. ""You're thetaing all over the place.""

""I guess so. Yes, I'm nervous.""

""Then let's try it again.""

They did, the technician rubbing the greasy electrode salve on Ellaby's forehead before putting the electrodes back on. The result was the same. ""More than average theta,"" said the technician, writing something in code on his employment blank. ""See the personnel advisor, please.""

For Ellaby, it was a shock. His heart pounded. He was emotionally unstable. Had the ten years been for nothing?

* * * * *

""Sit down, Ellaby,"" the personnel advisor said. He was a middle-aged man who didn't care much about his appearance. He had dyed his graying hair, but you could see gray at the roots. His green Thursday tunic was poorly starched. He'd had a full week to get it ready, so it was inexcusable.

""You have a great record, Ellaby,"" the sloppy personnel clerk said. ""Mentally, you're very close to average. Physically, even closer. Unfortunately, your emotional--""

""That never happened to me before, not in High Falls,"" Ellaby interrupted.

""This is not High Falls. Every community has its own security testing center. And the capitol requires the tightest security.""

""I know, but I was nervous. You're going to tell me my theta was too high, aren't you?""

""That's correct. You needn't feel so bad about it. You're going to be cleared for secret work. You're close to average, Ellaby. You're a good security risk. Incidentally, why were you nervous?""

""Because I wanted top secret clearance. Because I wanted to work close to the Dictator. You see--"" Suddenly, Ellaby stopped talking, realizing he wasn't supposed to say this. Lying was not in Ellaby's nature, but he hadn't been asked for all that information directly. ""What kind of job will I get?"" he asked, trying to change the subject.

It was too late. The personnel clerk asked, ""Why did you want to work close to the Dictator?""

Ellaby felt a drop of sweat roll down his side. He wanted to be back in High Falls. Anywhere but here.

""Why, Ellaby?""

""I can't answer that question. A man isn't forced to answer a question unless he wants to.""

""Certainly not,"" said the personnel advisor, staring at Ellaby. ""This is a democratic country.""

""Then--""

""But you've never known a man to refuse answering a question asked of him officially, have you?""

""I'm not sure I understand, sir.""

""You don't have to be so polite, Ellaby. I'm less average than you are, but I make the best of my differences. Did you ever hear of a criminal not confessing to his crime?""

""Well, no.""

""I'll ask you the question again, Ellaby. Why did you want to work near the Dictator?""

The man leaned close, peered at Ellaby. The room was small, almost a cubicle, the bare walls seeming to close in. Ellaby stifled a wild impulse to scream and run out. ""I'm sorry, but I can't answer that question,"" he said finally.

""Tell me, Ellaby, did you ever hear your own voice?""

What a strange question. ""Why, certainly. All the time when I speak.""

""No, I mean your voice reproduced artificially. Your radio voice?""

""No, I never heard it.""

""Well, you're about to.""

While the personnel advisor set up the radio equipment, Ellaby thought. He could still confess everything. They had chosen him--Mulden, the Sinclair woman, and the others in High Falls--for his average-ness. Very well, he could use that to get out. He didn't understand. He didn't know what they were leading him to over ten years. He didn't want to assassinate the Dictator. What would he want to do that for? He would name all the names he knew if they would let him forget the whole experience and return to High Falls. He could attend Adjustment Academy if they thought he needed it. Anything. Anything....

""Please put these earphones on.""

Ellaby did as he was told. *Click! Click!* A pair of cuffs locked his wrists to the chair. Ellaby looked at the personnel tester in alarm. ""What did you do that for?"" he asked timidly.

""So you won't remove the earphones. Now, are we ready?"" The personnel advisor pressed a button. Ellaby thought he heard a faint hum. ""I will ask you once more, Ellaby. Why did you want to work near the Dictator?""

Ellaby shrugged. He was going to say, ""I'm sorry, but I don't have to answer that question."" He said, and heard: ""I'm sorry (I'm) but I (sorry don't have (but) to ans (I) wer that (don't) question) (have to answer that question).""

""Again, please. I didn't hear you,"" the personnel tester said.

It was his own voice Ellaby had heard. Playback, with a small delay. It un-nerved him. The reproduced voice shouldn't lag. He shouted, ""I'm sorry (I'm) but I (sorry) don't have (but) to ans (I) wer that (don't question!) (have to) Shut up! (answer) SHUT UP! (that) PLEASE.... (question). PLEASE! (please).""

""Once more, if you don't mind.""

Ellaby's head was spinning. He blinked sweat from his eyes. ""I--please! (I--please!)""

""The law requires that you make some answer, even if it's a refusal.""

Criminals confessed, Ellaby thought wildly. Is this why criminals confessed? Did their own voices drive them mad? It seemed such a simple device, and yet...but he could fool it. He couldn't rush the words out: ""I don't have (I don't answer that ques) (have to) tion (answer that question.)"" Ellaby--and Ellaby's echo. ""Well, I (well) don't (I don't)!"" Ellaby blinked more sweat from his eyes. ""Mumble (mumble). Sob. (Sob).""

""Relax, Ellaby. You seem upset. Will you read this, please?"" the personnel advisor held a card in front of Ellaby.

The words blurred, fused, then were readable. Ellaby read aloud: ""A code (a) of eth (code) ics for (eth) mankind (ethics for mankind)."" It was the preamble to the constitution. ""In the (in) nineteenth (the) centur (nine) y the (nine) common (teenth)""--faster, faster!--""(century the common) c-common man was defended (common man) by enlightened liberalism (man was). In the t-twentieth century (in the t-twen) common man was championed by (tieth century) enlightened liberalism (the common man was). In the twenty-first century (championed by enlightened) the common man assumed his proper place (liberalism) at the top of society but (in the twenty-first cen) will protect the rights of the (tury the common man) enlightened liberals or any other minority, (assumed his proper) encouraging them to become (place at the top of) as common as possible (society but will protect the rights of the enlightened liberals or any other minority, encouraging them to become as common as possible).

""Oh God (Oh),"" shouted Ellaby. ""Shut (God) it (shut) off (it) make (off) it (make) stop (it) God (stop--God)!""

""Will you agree to answer my question?""

""Anything (anything)! ANYTHING (anything)."" Now the playback was a faint whisper. Ellaby found himself fascinated by it, trying to guess the time-lapse, which varied. Ellaby's head slumped forward. The wetness at the corners of his mouth was drool. He had given himself a mild, temporary nervous breakdown.

Two hours later, he was asked one question. He answered: ""I want to be near the Dictator so I can kill him.""

* * * * *

Later, Dorcas Sinclair asked: ""What else happened at testing, Ellaby?""

""Take your time,"" Mulden cautioned. ""He looks nervous.""

""I know it. I want to find out why.""

""After my EEG,"" said Ellaby softly, ""they told me I had too much theta.""

""Damn you!"" Dorcas Sinclair swore. ""Then you weren't cleared for top secret?""

""No, I wasn't. Not at first. Then a strange thing happened. They said I was cleared only for secret and asked me why I wanted to be cleared for top secret.""

""You fool!"" the woman cried.

""I told them it was because I wanted to work near the Dictator. I didn't mean to tell them, but--""

The woman shook her head in despair. ""Don't bother finishing,"" she said. ""You can clear out of here, Ellaby. You're through. Ten years. Ten years wasted.""

""If you wish,"" Ellaby said. ""But you're missing the most interesting part. They asked me why I wanted to be near the Dictator.""

Dorcas Sinclair sucked in her breath sharply. Even Mulden seemed anxious. ""You didn't tell them?"" the woman asked in a frantic whisper.

""I'm afraid I did.""

""We'll have to flee the city,"" the woman told Mulden, ignoring Ellaby. ""If he told them that, he probably named names. I have friends in Hampton Roads--""

""Let him finish,"" Mulden said. Mulden was looking strangely at Ellaby.

""They didn't ask me to name anyone in the conspiracy,"" Ellaby said. ""Unless they could hide it well, they seemed calm. They said they would make an exception in my case. They would clear me for top secret work. I start tomorrow.""

""What's your job?"" Mulden asked eagerly.

""Well, this is the strangest part. I'm to be the Dictator's confidential assistant.""

""Of course!"" Mulden cried. ""It makes sense. Don't you see, Sinclair? We're not the only ones. There are others, inside the government, who think it's time for a change. With their help, Ellaby won't fail us.""

Dorcas Sinclair wasn't convinced. ""Doesn't it seem peculiar to you that, purely by coincidence, Ellaby happened to meet these people?""

But Mulden shrugged. ""You know the old saying about the gift horse,"" he said. ""Ellaby will go ahead with the plan. Tomorrow, if all goes well, we'll have a revolution. Don't you understand, Sinclair? The Dictator--a figurehead. There are plenty of people like us, who don't want to do things just because everyone else does, who don't want to be stamped by conformity, who don't want...but I don't have to go on. The Dictator is a figurehead, a symbol of power. Destroy him and the whole conforming system collapses. You'll see tomorrow.""

It was all beyond Ellaby, who was still weary from the playback ordeal. He took the small blaster from Mulden and slipped it into his tunic. Tomorrow he would assassinate the Dictator and face the consequences. He almost wanted to rebel. The people at testing had been nice--except for the earphones. But the Sinclair woman and Mulden might do worse. He'd go through with it.

Under the circumstances, he slept surprisingly well.

* * * * *

Mulden's passionate parting words still ringing in his ears, Ellaby entered the capitol building. ""Someday you and your kind will understand, Ellaby,"" Mulden had said. ""Someday you'll know what banal really means, and vulgar. Someday--I promise you, someday--the true social perspective will be re-established. It should not be the role in life of the common man, the mass, the mob, to make the uncommon man as common as possible, but quite the other way around. The other way, Ellaby! Common folk should be given the opportunity to become as uncommon as possible. Otherwise, Ellaby, we've reached a dead end.

""Kill him and I promise you this: the whole warped system will come tumbling. A man shouldn't be forced to conform, Ellaby. Mankind's greatness stems from lack of conformity. For his own purposes, the Dictator bows to the will of the mob. But he's surrounded himself with mediocrity. Without him, what can they do? Without him they'll go down in weeks, Ellaby. In days!""

The guard, a tall blonde woman who looked like she was above average, led him down a long, well-lit corridor. No one had searched him. It would have taken the guard a moment to reach into his tunic, find the blaster, and take him away. Other people, on other errands, walked by without noticing Ellaby.

Was Mulden right? Were there people here, ready to help Ellaby?

Ellaby licked his dry lips and kept walking. His legs trembled. It was as if fear was following him, ready to catch him. The guard seemed unconcerned. She was humming a popular tune from High Falls.

The blonde guard stopped at a door. ""Here we are,"" she said.

Ellaby opened his mouth to speak, but took a breath instead. He felt a weak fluttering in his chest. He had never been so afraid.

The guard, taller than Ellaby, looked at him. ""You don't have to be so nervous,"" she said. ""Everything's going to be all right.""

""You see, it's a new job and all--""

""Oh, here! Let's see that blaster.""

Ellaby's heart dropped. He wanted to run. She knew. She knew...

He stood there, unable to move, while the guard reached inside his tunic, found the blaster taped to his chest, and took it out. She examined it. ""All right,"" she said. ""I only wanted to make sure it was loaded.""

And she took out a key and opened the door. ""He's inside,"" she said, and walked down the hall.

* * * * *

Ellaby clutched the doorframe for support. He was breathing heavily, as if he'd run the length of the corridor. He wiped his brow and entered the room.

A man Ellaby's size was sitting there, watching a 3D. When he heard Ellaby at the door, he got up. He looked unhappy as Ellaby pointed the blaster at him. He said, ""So soon?""

""They said you would try tricks,"" Ellaby recited. ""You won't fool me.""

""You think I'm the Dictator? You're going to kill me? That's very funny. I know, you see. I know.""

""Stand back!"" Ellaby screamed.

""I assure you, I am not the Dictator any more than you will be--""

The man's face dissolved as Ellaby pulled the trigger of his blaster.

He spent the next ten minutes being very ill.

Afterwards, they were efficient. They took the body away and told Ellaby all he had to do was ask for food or drink or anything he wanted. Occasionally, he would sign papers. Occasionally--masked--he might review a parade.

And all at once, sitting alone with a pleasant view, it came to Ellaby. He passed no judgment, but he understood--and he was afraid.

The masses ruled, thought Ellaby, not really knowing what it meant. The system was self-perpetuating, and revolution couldn't change it. The common man--men like Ellaby--had come into his own, for once and for all time.

The man Ellaby had killed was no Dictator. He had tried to tell Ellaby that. Now Ellaby had taken his place. Ellaby was no Dictator, either.

But he would do until the next one came along.

THE END

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Dictator, by Milton Lesser",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story ""The Dictator"" by Milton Lesser revolves around the tension between individuality and conformity within a society that prides itself on equality and democracy. The protagonist, Ellaby, is an average man selected for a mission to assassinate the Dictator due to his unremarkable nature, which makes him unsuspected and obedient. The narrative explores the paradox of a society that enforces conformity to maintain equality, yet suppresses individuality and dissent.

Ellaby's internal conflict arises from his struggle to comprehend the broader implications of his mission and his role within this conformist society. He is torn between his conditioning to follow instructions and his dawning awareness that the system may be flawed. The external conflict is embodied in the clandestine group's objective to overthrow the Dictator, symbolizing a rebellion against the oppressive societal norms.

Ultimately, the story reveals the futility of revolution in a self-perpetuating system where the common man's rise to power leads to the perpetuation of the same cycle. Ellaby's realization that the Dictator is merely a figurehead, and that he himself is to become the next one, underscores the narrative's exploration of the illusory nature of power and control in a society driven by conformity.",What if your chance to make a difference meant becoming the very thing you were fighting against?,"What if you were the only person who could stop a dictator, but you didn't even know who he was?",Could you pull the trigger on a stranger if you believed it would free everyone from the chains of conformity?,science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,What was Ellaby trained to do?,Ellaby was trained to assassinate the Dictator.,Why was Ellaby chosen for the mission?,"Ellaby was chosen because he was perfectly average, making him unsuspected by the government, and he was well-adjusted, meaning he would follow instructions.",What might happen if Ellaby fails his mission?,"If Ellaby fails his mission, the plan to overthrow the Dictator and disrupt the conforming system might not succeed, and the organization behind him could be exposed.",How does the society in the story maintain control over its citizens?,"The society maintains control by promoting conformity and mediocrity, using psychological testing to ensure compliance, and employing subtle psychological manipulation, such as the playback device, to extract confessions.",Do you think Ellaby's actions were justified?

035.txt,"In winter, the university library was almost as cold inside as it was outside, and it was really drafty. Gretchen often thought the only difference between inside and outside was that it didn’t snow inside. At least the library was dry. Most afternoons, you could see your breath in the less visited areas like the second and third floors. Gretchen thought it wasn't the best place for books but understood that heating such a big building would be super expensive. On the coldest days, she wore two petticoats. To keep warm, she moved quickly as she worked, mostly retrieving books for people and putting books back on the shelves.

Gretchen had just turned twenty-nine the day before and was trying to stay busy to distract herself from thinking about it. She had spent her birthday alone and knew it was better to be around people. She worried about getting older and what her future would look like. She only had to look at Miss Sadie, the assistant reference librarian, to see her own possible future. Gretchen found comfort in the books and the wisdom they contained, rather than a life working in a factory or being tied to an old-fashioned husband.

She had left her family six years ago and rarely thought about them since leaving Connecticut. Her father wanted her to marry after she finished university, but she refused to marry the man her father had chosen for her. Her mother had told her about marriage's ups and downs and confided in Gretchen that the hardships sometimes outweighed the pleasures. Gretchen didn’t want that life. She was grateful her mother had supported her education.

Gretchen loved the intellectual atmosphere at university and looked forward to working afterward. However, even with a great education, finding well-paid work was hard. She didn’t have high material aspirations and was content spending her days in the library, surrounded by books. She thought it was unfortunate that staying independent meant being lonely, but she’d seen many friends in unhappy marriages. She hoped to find a man who shared her interests and had modern ideas—someone she could have a mutual partnership with.

As she worked, she thought about these things, dreading her next birthday. She was about to fix her hair when she bumped into a man in the library. She tried to stop, but the books she was carrying fell, scattering everywhere. The man tried to catch them but only managed to save one. She apologized and knelt to gather the books, worrying she had damaged them.

""It's my fault,"" the man said lightly, helping her pick up the books. She noticed he was well-dressed and had kind, dark eyes. After they finished picking up the books, he stood, brushed back his curly hair, and with a polite nod, walked away. Gretchen felt a bit flustered but continued her work.

Over the next two weeks, Gretchen saw the man several times in the library, and they exchanged greetings. She found him interesting and thought he might be a professor, perhaps a young assistant. One day, Miss Sadie felt unwell and asked Gretchen to cover the desk until closing. Gretchen agreed, happy to do something different. As she tidied the desk, the man approached, asking for help finding a book that wasn’t in the open stacks.

Gretchen realized the book was in a special collection and offered to fetch it for him. It wasn’t usual for patrons to access the special collections, but she figured she could make an exception for a professor. He introduced himself as Professor Bridwell, and they had a pleasant conversation as she retrieved the book for him.

Later, Gretchen attended a concert on campus. During the performance, she spotted Professor Bridwell in the audience. Afterward, as the audience left, he greeted her warmly. They talked briefly about the concert, and he invited her for coffee. Gretchen accepted, and they enjoyed a lively conversation at a nearby café. They shared their thoughts on music and life, and Gretchen found herself intrigued by him.

As they walked back, they talked about their lives. Gretchen admitted she had few friends nearby and was estranged from her family. Professor Bridwell shared that he spent most of his time with his books and was also unattached. They walked together in the falling snow, and Gretchen felt a connection with him. She hoped they would see each other again.

**The Hungarian Lightbulb**

When the symphony orchestra collapsed, all the musicians lost their jobs. Many people were out of work, and the musicians had to find other jobs, often for low pay. Jurgen, a talented violist, refused to give up his music. He traveled west, hoping to find a place with fewer musicians. He arrived in a new city and found a cheap hotel to stay in.

The hotel was run-down, but he could afford it. The manager didn’t mind if he practiced his viola during the day. Jurgen settled into his small room, hoping to find work soon. He spent his days playing on street corners, earning just enough for food. One evening, he found a small club called ""Calcutta."" Inside, he discovered a group of musicians playing jazz.

Jurgen was invited to join them, and he played a Hungarian folk tune on his viola. The musicians were impressed, and he was invited to play with them regularly. Jurgen found joy in the music and camaraderie at the club. He felt at home among the musicians and enjoyed the freedom of playing jazz.

As Christmas approached, Jurgen became a regular at the club. On Christmas Eve, the club was packed with people. Mabel, one of the singers, thanked Jurgen for bringing in more customers and offered him a place to stay. She also had a plan to introduce him to a conductor who might help him find a job.

Jurgen was touched by the kindness and agreed to move in with Mabel’s brother. On Christmas Day, he left the hotel, taking with him a lightbulb from Hungary as a reminder of his grandmother.

**Christmas Concert**

It was a few nights before Christmas, and the freeway was jammed with cars. I was stuck in traffic, trying to get to my daughter’s concert. I was running late and frustrated with the slow-moving cars. As I drove, a Christmas tree fell off the car in front of me, causing a small accident. The driver apologized and offered me the tree as a gesture of goodwill.

I arrived at the concert just in time for intermission. My daughter, Jenny, was about to perform her first solo. She had chosen to switch from violin to viola a few years ago, which had surprised me. But she was determined and had become quite good.

As Jenny took the stage, she tripped and hurt her ankle. She insisted on going on with the performance, despite her injury. I offered to turn the pages of her music for her as she played.

Jenny played beautifully, and the audience was moved by her performance. During the second movement, I realized how much music meant to her and how talented she was. I felt proud of her and grateful to be part of her debut.

After the concert, we attended a reception where Jenny was greeted warmly by friends and audience members. On the way home, we stopped at the hospital to check her ankle. Despite the earlier mishap, Jenny was in high spirits, and I was happy to have shared the special evening with her.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"In the story about Gretchen, the central conflict revolves around her struggle for independence and the loneliness that sometimes accompanies it. Gretchen is navigating her path in a society that expects her to follow traditional roles, such as marrying the man her father chose for her. She desires intellectual fulfillment and independence, yet this choice often leaves her feeling isolated. Her encounter with Professor Bridwell introduces the possibility of a relationship that aligns with her values, presenting a dilemma between maintaining her independence and pursuing companionship.

In ""The Hungarian Lightbulb,"" the central conflict involves Jurgen's determination to continue his passion for music despite the economic hardships and job loss following the collapse of the symphony orchestra. Jurgen's journey reflects the struggle between pursuing one's passion and the necessity of finding stable work. His integration into the jazz club and the support he receives from fellow musicians help resolve this conflict, allowing him to continue his musical journey in a new form.

In ""Christmas Concert,"" the central conflict lies in the narrator's race against time and circumstances to attend their daughter's concert.

037.txt,"These stunning women were just as skilled with men, murder, or marriage, and they used all three to their advantage.

Dr. Hubert Long, a 40-year-old single man and assistant professor of political science at Mentioch University, pushed his rugged face forward, really sticking his neck out.

""The Humanist Party,"" he shouted to the 800 students in the lecture hall, ""is not a political party at all. It's a group of powerful people in Washington who make our elections a joke. Our elections are set up so that a select group of feminists stays in charge.""

The students, a mix of seniors, were wide-eyed and many started taking notes.

""This might cost me my job at the university,"" he said seriously, ""but it's time for all responsible citizens to realize that the Government of the United States has become almost like a dictatorship!""

The room filled with whispers and a young man in a bowtie stood up, breaking the no-questions rule in Long's large class. ""Can the Mentioch Bugle quote you, Dr. Long?""

""You can headline those views, and I hope you do,"" Long replied, sounding defiant.

""Exactly what do you mean by calling the Humanist Party a group of feminists?"" the young man asked.

Long looked around at the amused faces of the male students and the annoyed faces of the females. He stared directly at the campus reporter. ""You might think, because only 30 percent of our legislators are women, that men still control Congress?""

""I think that's what most people believe,"" the reporter responded in a condescending tone.

""Think again. Look at the Senate and House, and check out the key committee appointments by gender. You'll find three-fourths of these posts held by women, and the rest are men whose wives are top Humanist Party members. Our nation is controlled by a few female fanatics who don't care about intellectual honesty.""

""What are your accusations? Can you list them?""

""I will, I will,"" Long shouted, ignoring the microphone. ""Without caring about our national reputation, the Humanist Party has weakened our power as a world leader with its peaceful actions. At home, the Party has started a so-called Internal Security program, which is really a plan to control us from cradle to grave. We're becoming slaves to the soft, weak government in Washington that feeds us, pampers us, and enforces its crazy policies with goon squads!""

""Goon squads?"" The young reporter lost his smile. ""You better explain that, Dr. Long. I don't want to get in trouble for what you say.""

""Keep quoting me,"" Long growled. ""I said goon squads, and I meant it. I used to be part of a group of political scientists who criticized our government. Out of eighteen members, I'm the only one left in public life. The rest have disappeared, and I think my silence until now is what saved me. But the time for staying quiet is over. If we want to save our independence and democratic freedoms, the time to act is now! I say to you—""

This statement made headlines not just at Mentioch but across the nation, as news-wire services spread the word. Dr. Long's extreme views were reported on pages two and three everywhere.

Emily Bogarth, head of Internal Security, was furious with her assistant, bald-headed Terman Donlup. ""Do I have to read about these things in the papers to know about subversive activity?""

""But the man's record shows he's stable,"" Donlup defended. ""He just exploded out of nowhere. The Dean of Women at Mentioch tells me Dr. Long has never been criticized by his department head. Should we remove him from his position right away?""

Madame Secretary Bogarth shook her head. ""That's not enough. We need to get rid of him. I want a special team on this one."" She started writing names of some of the most effective and ruthless operators in the party's top ranks on a sheet of paper.

She handed it to Donlup. ""This man is dangerous. He could force us to openly control the press and higher education. Get these people here by tomorrow. We can't waste time.""

""Yes, Madame Secretary,"" Donlup said with a full bow and got to work.

The next afternoon, Emily Bogarth met with the squad and its brilliant, green-eyed leader. She told them their mission and then dismissed all but one. ""I'm sorry to give you this task. You had a promising career ahead of you. But this man is a threat to our cause. Believe me, I'm not wasting your special skills.""

""If it's for the good of the Party—""

""Dr. Hubert Long is a lit fuse,"" Emily Bogarth said, looking hard at her operator, ""that could blow the Humanist movement sky-high. I want you to put out that fuse."" She pressed her forefinger against her thumb.

The operator nodded, and the green eyes flashed with the same fanatic spark that had electrified American politics at the turn of the 21st century and launched the Humanist Party into its 30-year rule.

At first, Dr. Long was met with shocked, embarrassed silence on the campus of Mentioch University. But as his statements gained more attention in the press, so did his reputation.

He began to have local visitors who were very interested in his views. By the end of the first week, he was speaking every evening to a good-sized group at his small house on the edge of faculty row.

Being a careful, practical man, Hubert Long now carried a small pistol in his coat pocket, but he was also fearless and independent. He welcomed all visitors and exposed himself to the public daily. It wasn't just personal bravado, though. He knew from years of research that the goon squads rarely attacked in public. When they came for him, he hoped they'd make a mistake and prove his point about their operations.

Even though he didn't seek martyrdom, Dr. Long was ready for it, as he explained to the group that had gathered at his home this Sunday afternoon. It was late evening, and the endless questions were starting to tire him out.

""How do you know,"" asked a skeptical businessman, ""that I’m not an assassin who will ambush you on the way to the bathroom tonight?""

There were several ladies present, and bachelor Long blushed with annoyance. ""You might very well be,"" he replied. ""But I probably have some temporary protection from the publicity I've received. My death, if it happens, will likely look like natural causes or an unfortunate accident.""

He got up. ""It's getting late, and I have an early class. Will you excuse me? Thank you for coming, everyone."" He nodded, trying to smile, but the businessman's comment kept bothering him. It was very possible that one or more members of a goon squad were among the twenty-some people now leaving his worn carpet, footstool, coffee table, and the simple furniture he could afford on his salary.

With a small start, he realized that a young woman, appearing to be in her early thirties, was staying behind. Sure enough, she closed the door after the others and turned a lovely face to him. ""I think you are magnificent, Dr. Long,"" she said impulsively. ""I hope you will spare me just a few minutes alone?""

Long casually slipped his right hand into his coat pocket. When standing, the woman showed more than a pretty face. Her figure was very feminine and confidently displayed, with her feet apart, hips forward, and shoulders back. Her hair was nearly platinum blonde, but so well styled, it was hard to tell if it was natural.

She noticed his hesitation. ""Maybe you’d feel better out on the porch,"" she suggested, smiling with such understanding that Long felt a bit rude.

""No. Sit down, please. I didn’t catch your name earlier.""

""Julie Stone,"" she introduced herself and extended a long, bare arm. Her hand squeezed his fingers warmly, more like a man's grip. ""My brother is Senator Stone, and he asked me to stop by and meet you. Secretly he agrees with much of what you have said, but of course, he is hesitant to speak out until a formal movement is underway.""

Long relaxed a little. This was good news, the first he had received. Political figures were staying silent in the press, and this was the first sign of support he had from anyone more influential than reporters.

She continued, ""Specifically, my brother would like to know which of the other two political parties you favor if you plan to reach out through such channels.""

""Either party,"" Long said with some emphasis. ""I would like to see a coalition of the Democratic and Republican Parties to overthrow this Humanist group.""

Her forehead wrinkled. ""That's exactly what Tom thinks. He's not sure it can be done, but he believes the attention you've received suggests it might be possible if handled right.""

""Yes, the so-called free press,"" he said. ""Some people have pointed that out to me. If the Humanists were dictators, they say, we wouldn’t have this free press that has spread my remarks. I see it differently. The Humanists have convinced the press to support them, controlling the papers in the most effective way. You’ll notice they’ve reported my speeches just as news, as oddities. Editorials have been very noncommittal.""

""I hope you are right,"" Long said. He made a pot of coffee, and they discussed the matter at length. He liked her direct approach, but she surprised him as she was leaving.

""I have much to tell my brother,"" she said. ""Just out of curiosity, though, are you sure personal feelings about women haven't influenced your attack against the government?""

It hit him like a punch. Her detached manner almost made him forget she was a woman. Now this.

""Why—why do you ask?""

She shrugged. ""It was a natural thought. There aren’t many confirmed bachelors these days.""

""Oh, that!"" He smiled. ""You're right, there aren’t many single men over twenty-one anymore, with all the government propaganda and tax incentives. I assure you, it’s nothing personal. My tastes are simply too expensive.""

""Your tastes?"" She raised an eyebrow.

""That's right. A lovely woman is a work of art, but like any other masterpiece, she’s a luxury I can't afford. Anyway, this face of mine rather put me out of the running in the leagues I've wanted to play in. You said you’re Miss Julie Stone, didn’t you?""

""No, but it happens to be correct.""

""What's your excuse?""

""For being single? I'm a career girl. I have my own modeling agency. Too busy, for one thing. And I guess a woman gets tired of looking at handsome men in my business. Not a brain among them. Just good looks and wavy hair. Ugh! Animals! Each and every one.""

""Young woman, that’s sedition. Don’t you believe the government propaganda?""

""If I did, do you think I'd be here? No, Dr. Long, I find your arguments quite valid. America is in the hands of feminists, all right, and it's the fault of several generations of mama’s boys. I just can’t get—""

She stopped as a heavy truck rolled by outside, backfiring loudly. They were both silhouetted in the open door. She glanced out, and suddenly she threw herself on him, pulling him to the floor. They landed in a tangle of limbs and nylon.

The noise faded down the street, but Dr. Long's mind was not on the sound. The touch of this beautiful woman’s skin under his hands filled his thoughts. How different, how soft, incredibly soft!

Now she was clinging to him, trembling and breathing deeply. Even from this close, her pale hair looked natural. ""Are you all right?"" she asked finally.

""Of course,"" he said, sitting up reluctantly. ""It was only a truck backfiring.""

""Look!"" She pointed behind him at the wall. A line of small, deep holes cut across, about chest-high. ""I saw the gun barrel as the truck came up,"" she explained, getting up. ""It seems your temporary safety is over. They’re getting active.""

Long stared in disbelief at the serious little holes. With the reactions of a trained thinker, he relaxed instead of getting scared. He had made his decision days ago, and he knew the risks.

""Thanks for nothing!"" he said coldly.

Julie Stone looked at him and studied his lined face. ""So you really were expecting an attack?"" She shook her head in disgust. ""I finally meet a man with some guts, and the only way he can think to win is to let a goon squad make headlines with his guts!""

She sat in an armchair and crossed her knees. Long stood in the middle of the floor staring at the woman he had held minutes ago, and his head pounded. ""What—what else is there to do?"" he asked hoarsely. ""This was my best chance to show the reality of our police state. I have more to die for than to live for. This has been my life's work—gathering facts and presenting them dramatically. My only fear was that they wouldn’t come for me, and I’d be written off as a crackpot.""

""I regret,"" she said, ""that I have but one life to give to my country!"" Then she curled her lip. ""Very well, brainy, if that’s the best you can think of. Let’s make it better. How about this for a headline: Dr. Long and Lovely Model Murdered by Federal Hoods!""

""Are you insane?""

She shook her head. ""I'm serious. I'm staying in the line of fire until you figure out how to stay alive at a profit.""

He argued, pleaded, and even lost his temper, trying to force her out. But he didn’t succeed. Somehow his arms slipped around her, and she clung to him in a defiant embrace. Her soft warmth, her sweet breath, and the faint scent of her perfume surrounded him in a confusing weakness.

Live at a profit? How could a man want to die with Julie Stone in his arms?

The thought of her beautiful form crumpled and riddled with bullets tore at his resolve, and he kissed her with the hunger of a doomed man.

""Julie, Julie! Why did you have to—""

""One bullet, a single bullet will do it now."" Her lips peeled back from her white teeth. ""Let's stay this way, darling. That's the way you want it.""

Her low, black sedan sped at 100 miles per hour on the Freeway as they crossed the state line. In the back seat, lying out of sight, his head on his briefcase full of evidence against the Humanist Party, was a very thoughtful Dr. Hubert Long, recently of Mentioch University.

He had driven until dawn while Julie Stone slept, and now, after a short nap, he was waking to the morning's realities.

This escape was ridiculous. When the federal people found out he wasn’t dead, they’d come after him again and again. All he did was involve this lovely woman. He hadn’t feared for his own life, but now he knew the agony of fearing for the woman he loved.

The emotion was genuine and no less powerful for its quick development overnight. Dr. Hubert Long was hopelessly in love with Julie Stone.

""Quit worrying,"" she called back to him. ""They couldn't have spotted my car. I parked it a block from your house, remember?""

""I hope you have a plan,"" Long muttered. ""I sure don’t. Where are we going?""

""Florida. To my brother's winter place. You know, I just had a thought. Tom and I are both on the board of regents of Toppinhout College down there, and there’ll be an opening next quarter in the faculty. A professorship, in fact.""

Long grunted. ""No way. They’ll be watching every political scientist for years.""

""This is the chair of anthropology,"" she said. ""We can change your name, and after this excitement dies down—""

""But I don’t want it to die down!"" he objected.

""I thought we settled that. You have to stay alive to talk to important people. Tom and I will get them to listen to you. My brother is the senior Senator, and he's been eager to leave the Humanist Party for years.""

""What can I achieve in secret meetings? The people must be awakened.""

""I know, I know, from a soapbox in Times Square, I suppose. Darling, you can't do this alone. They’ve shown they’re willing to kill you, so they must be stronger than you think. Your facts must reach the right people. Over time, we can build a strong movement.""

""Toppinhout is a girls' college.""

""So?""

""I've never taught anthropology before.""

""You've never been married before, either,"" she pointed out, ""but I predict you’ll succeed at both.""

""Married?"" Long popped his head up.

She smiled at him in the rear-view mirror. ""Get your head down before you get it blown off. Yes, I said married. I'm not letting that face of yours out of my sight. And I’m afraid Tom will shoot you himself if you don’t make it official. Tom's old-fashioned.""

""But—I couldn't support you on—""

""A full professor's salary? Don’t be silly. Besides, I'm selling my agency. That’ll set us up.""

That such a simple term as ""set us up"" should make his heart race didn’t seem strange to Dr. Hubert Long. How could a man focus on dying when a treasure like Julie seemed within reach? He knew his plans had changed forever.

Emily Bogarth turned to the phone speaker as her assistant gave a signal.

""About the Hubert Long mission—"" the speaker said. ""Mission accomplished. Do you have a story for the press?""

""Never mind that. Did it go as planned?""

""Exactly. Your marksmen did a good job.""

Emily Bogarth sighed. ""Sorry to sacrifice you, honey, but the other way is too messy.""

""Don’t mention it. This guy has an interesting mind. He’s a challenge—in more ways than one. By the way, let Senator Stone know. Have him fly to his winter home. He’ll be needed. Some Party members, too.""

""Of course. That’s all arranged. Good luck!""

""Thanks, but don’t worry. Dr. Hubert Long is completely taken care of.""

Julie stepped from the phone booth and paid for the gasoline. The attendant looked at her and wondered who the lucky guy in the back seat might be. A man would do anything for a look from those green eyes. 

**THE END**",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Dr. Hubert Long's confrontation with the powerful Humanist Party, which he accuses of turning the United States into a dictatorship controlled by feminists. Dr. Long's public denouncement of the party puts him at risk, as the party, led by Emily Bogarth, sees him as a threat that needs to be eliminated. The story explores themes of political power, control, and resistance, with Dr. Long standing as a lone voice against a system he perceives as oppressive.

The dilemma intensifies with the introduction of Julie Stone, a woman who initially appears to be an ally but is later revealed to be working for the party. The personal conflict for Dr. Long arises as he falls in love with Julie, which complicates his mission and forces him to reconsider his approach. He must choose between continuing his public battle against the party at the risk of both their lives or finding a way to fight from within the system, as Julie suggests.

Ultimately, the story ends with the revelation that Julie is part of a larger plan orchestrated by the party to neutralize Dr. Long while keeping him alive and under control, thereby resolving the conflict in a way that maintains the party's dominance and influence.",Imagine you discover a secret plan to control your country.

038.txt,"Myself, I do not believe this story. Six people are convinced it's true, and they hope to convince themselves it was just a hallucination. The problem is that there are six of them. Each one, when alone, clearly sees that it couldn't have happened. Unfortunately, they are close friends and can't get away from each other; when they meet and look into each other's eyes, the story seems real again.

The person who told it to me, and then immediately regretted it, was Armitage. He told it to me one night when we were the only ones in the Club smoking room. He later explained that telling me was a spur-of-the-moment decision. The thought of it had been weighing on him all day, and he hoped my skeptical and ordinary mind might help him see how absurd it was. I think it did help. He thanked me for dismissing his story as the delusion of a troubled mind and asked me not to tell a soul. I promised, and I don't consider this as breaking my promise. Armitage isn’t his real name; it doesn’t even start with an A. You could read this story and have dinner next to him the same evening and not know it.

I didn't think I was breaking my promise by talking, discreetly, to Mrs. Armitage, a charming woman. She burst into tears at the first mention of it, and it took everything I knew to calm her down. She said when she didn't think about it, she could be happy. She and Armitage never spoke of it to each other, and left alone, she thought they might eventually forget it. She wished they weren't so friendly with the Everetts. Mr. and Mrs. Everett had both had the same dream—assuming it was a dream. Mr. Everett wasn't the kind of person a clergyman should, perhaps, know; but as Armitage always argued: for a teacher of Christianity to stop being friends with someone just because they're a sinner would be inconsistent. They dined with the Everetts every Tuesday, and while sitting across from them, it seemed impossible to believe all four of them had the same illusion at the same time. I think I left her more hopeful. She agreed the story sounded ridiculous and threatened me that if I ever told anyone, she would never speak to me again. She is a charming woman, as I’ve said.

Coincidentally, I happened to be one of Everett's directors on a company he had just started to develop the Red Sea Coasting trade. I lunched with him the following Sunday. He is an interesting talker, and I was curious to see how such a clever man would explain his connection to such a crazy idea, so I hinted that I knew about the story. His and his wife's manner changed suddenly. They wanted to know who had told me. I refused to say, because it was clear they would be angry with him. Everett's theory was that one of them had dreamed it—probably Camelford—and by hypnotic suggestion had made the others think they had dreamed it too. He added that but for one small incident, he would have laughed at the idea it could be anything but a dream. But he wouldn't tell me what that incident was. He said he wanted to forget about it. Speaking as a friend, he advised me not to talk about it either, or it might cause trouble with my director's fees. He sometimes puts things bluntly.

I met Mrs. Camelford at the Everetts' later on. She was one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. I foolishly forgot that Mr. and Mrs. Camelford were the other two involved and mentioned the story as a curious tale I had read years ago. I hoped it would lead to a discussion with her about platonic friendship. She jumped up from her chair and gave me a look. I remembered then and could have bitten my tongue. It took me a long while to make peace, but she eventually forgave me, attributing my blunder to stupidity. She was quite convinced herself it was pure imagination. It was only when with the others that she had doubts. Her idea was if everyone agreed never to mention it again, they would forget it. She supposed her husband had told me: he was just that kind of fool, she said, not unkindly. She said when she first married, ten years ago, few people irritated her more than Camelford; but since she had seen more of other men, she had come to respect him. I like to hear a woman speak well of her husband. It's something that should be encouraged. I assured her Camelford was not the one who told me; and on the condition that I might see her—not too often—on her Thursdays, I agreed the best thing was to forget the subject and focus on matters that concerned me.

I hadn't talked much with Camelford before then, though I often saw him at the Club. He is a strange man, and many stories are told about him. He writes journalism for a living and poetry, which he publishes at his own expense, apparently for fun. I thought his theory would at least be interesting, but at first, he wouldn't talk, pretending to ignore the whole affair as nonsense. I had almost given up trying to get him to talk when one evening, he asked me if I thought Mrs. Armitage, whom he knew I was friends with, still cared about it. I said I thought Mrs. Armitage was the most troubled by it, and this annoyed him. He urged me to focus on convincing her it was just a myth. He admitted that to him, it was still a mystery. He could easily see it as a dream, except for one small incident. He wouldn't say what that was for a long time, but perseverance paid off, and I finally got it out of him. This is what he told me.

""We happened to find ourselves alone in the conservatory that night of the ball—we six. Most of the crowd had already left. The last 'extra' was being played: the music came to us faintly. I stooped to pick up Jessica's fan, which she had dropped, and something shiny on the floor caught my eye. We hadn't said a word to each other; in fact, it was the first evening any of us had met—unless it wasn't a dream. I picked it up. The others gathered round me, and when we looked into each other's eyes, we understood: it was a broken wine cup, a curious goblet of Bavarian glass. It was the goblet we all dreamed we had drunk from.""

I have put the story together as it seems to me it must have happened. The incidents, at least, are facts. Things have occurred since to those involved, giving me hope they will never read it. I wouldn't have bothered to tell it, except that it has a moral.

Six people sat around a large oak table in the dining hall of the cozy Kneiper Hof in Konigsberg. It was late at night. Under normal circumstances, they would have been in bed, but having arrived by the last train from Dantzic and having eaten German food, it seemed wiser to them to stay up and talk. The house was very quiet. The round landlord had left their candles on the sideboard and wished them ""Gute Nacht"" an hour before. The spirit of the old house surrounded them.

In this very room, if rumors are to be believed, Emmanuel Kant himself had often sat talking. The walls, where for more than forty years the little peak-faced man had thought and worked, rose silvered by the moonlight just across the street; the three high windows of the dining hall looked out on the old Cathedral tower beneath which he now rests. Philosophy, curious about human nature, eager for experience, unhampered by the limits Convention would impose on all thinking, was in the smoky air.

""Not into future events,"" remarked the Rev. Nathaniel Armitage, ""it's better they stay hidden from us. But into our own future—our temperament, our character—I think we should be allowed to see. At twenty we are one person; at forty, another person entirely, with different views, different interests, a different outlook on life, attracted by different things, repelled by what once attracted us. It's very awkward for all of us.""

""I'm glad to hear someone else say that,"" observed Mrs. Everett in her gentle, sympathetic voice. ""I've thought it myself so often. Sometimes I've blamed myself, yet how can one help it: the things that seemed important to us become indifferent; new voices call to us; the idols we once worshipped, we see their feet of clay.""

""If by idols you mean me,"" laughed the jovial Mr. Everett, ""don't hesitate to say so."" He was a large red-faced gentleman, with small twinkling eyes, and a mouth both strong and sensuous. ""I didn't make my feet myself. I never asked anybody to think of me as a stained-glass saint. It's not me who has changed.""

""I know, dear, it's me,"" his thin wife answered with a meek smile. ""I was beautiful, there was no doubt about it, when you married me.""

""You were, my dear,"" agreed her husband: ""As a girl, few could hold a candle to you.""

""It was the only thing about me you valued, my beauty,"" continued his wife; ""and it went so quickly. I feel sometimes like I swindled you.""

""But there's a beauty of the mind, of the soul,"" remarked the Rev. Nathaniel Armitage, ""that to some men is more attractive than mere physical perfection.""

The soft eyes of the faded lady shone for a moment with pleasure. ""I'm afraid Dick is not one of them,"" she sighed.

""Well, as I said just now about my feet,"" answered her husband genially, ""I didn't make myself. I've always been a slave to beauty and always will be. There would be no sense in pretending among friends that you haven't lost your looks, old girl."" He laid his fine hand with kindly intent upon her bony shoulder. ""But there's no need for you to fret as if you did it on purpose. No one but a lover imagines a woman grows more beautiful as she gets older.""

""Some women would seem to,"" answered his wife.

Involuntarily she glanced to where Mrs. Camelford sat with elbows resting on the table; and involuntarily also the small twinkling eyes of her husband followed in the same direction. There's a type that reaches its prime in middle age. Mrs. Camelford, formerly Jessica Dearwood, at twenty had been an odd-looking creature, the only thing about her appealing to general masculine taste being her magnificent eyes, and even these had frightened more than they had attracted. At forty, Mrs. Camelford might have posed for the entire Juno.

""Yes, he's a cunning old joker, Time,"" murmured Mr. Everett, almost inaudibly.

""What should have happened,"" said Mrs. Armitage, while deftly rolling herself a cigarette, ""was for you and Nellie to have married.""

Mrs. Everett's pale face flushed scarlet.

""My dear,"" exclaimed the shocked Nathaniel Armitage, flushing likewise.

""Oh, why can't one sometimes speak the truth?"" answered his wife petulantly. ""You and I are completely mismatched—everyone sees it. At nineteen it seemed to me beautiful, holy, the idea of being a clergyman's wife, fighting by his side against evil. Besides, you have changed since then. You were human, my dear Nat, in those days, and the best dancer I had ever met. It was your dancing that attracted me, as likely as not, if I had only known myself. At nineteen, how can one know oneself?""

""We loved each other,"" the Rev. Armitage reminded her.

""I know we did, passionately—then; but we don't now."" She laughed a little bitterly. ""Poor Nat! I'm just another trial for you. Your beliefs, your ideals are meaningless to me—mere narrow dogmas, stifling thought. Nellie was the wife Nature had intended for you, once she lost her beauty and her worldly ideas. Fate was maturing her for you, if only we had known. As for me, I should have been the wife of an artist, of a poet."" Unconsciously a glance from her ever restless eyes flashed across the table to where Horatio Camelford sat, puffing clouds of smoke from a huge black pipe. ""Bohemia is my country. Its poverty, its struggle would have been a joy to me. Breathing its free air, life would have been worth living.""

Horatio Camelford leaned back with eyes fixed on the oak ceiling. ""It's a mistake,"" said Horatio Camelford, ""for the artist ever to marry.""

The handsome Mrs. Camelford laughed good-naturedly. ""The artist,"" remarked Mrs. Camelford, ""from what I've seen, wouldn't know the inside of his shirt from the outside if his wife wasn't there to sort it out for him.""

""His wearing it inside out wouldn't make much difference to the world,"" argued her husband. ""The sacrifice of his art to keeping his wife and family does.""

""Well, you don't seem to have sacrificed much, my boy,"" came the breezy voice of Dick Everett. ""Why, everyone is talking about you.""

""When I'm forty-one, with all my best years behind me,"" answered the Poet. ""As a man, I have nothing to regret. No one could have had a better wife; my children are charming. I've lived the peaceful life of a successful citizen. Had I been true to my calling, I would have gone out into the wilderness, the only home for the teacher, the prophet. The artist is the bridegroom of Art. Marriage for him is wrong. Had I my time again, I’d stay single.""

""Time brings its revenges,"" laughed Mrs. Camelford. ""At twenty that fellow threatened to kill himself if I didn’t marry him, and disliking him, I agreed. Now twenty years later, when I'm just getting used to him, he calmly says he'd have been better without me.""

""I heard something about it,"" said Mrs. Armitage. ""You were very much in love with someone else, weren't you?""

""Isn't the conversation taking a dangerous turn?"" laughed Mrs. Camelford.

""I was thinking the same,"" agreed Mrs. Everett. ""It seems like some strange influence is making us speak our thoughts aloud.""

""I'm afraid I started it,"" admitted the Reverend Nathaniel Armitage. ""This room is becoming quite oppressive. Should we go to bed?""

The old lamp hanging from its smoky beam uttered a faint, gurgling sob, and spluttered out. The shadow of the old Cathedral tower crept in and stretched across the room, now lit only by occasional beams from the clouded moon. At the other end of the table sat a peak-faced little gentleman, clean-shaven, in a full-bottomed wig.

""Forgive me,"" said the little gentleman. He spoke in English, with a strong accent. ""But it seems to me here is a chance for two parties to help one another.""

The six fellow-travelers around the table looked at one another, but no one spoke. The idea that came to each of them, as they explained later, was that without remembering, they had taken their candles and gone to bed. This was surely a dream.

""It would greatly help me,"" continued the little peak-faced gentleman, ""in my experiments on human tendencies, if you would allow me to put your lives back twenty years.""

Still, none of the six replied. It seemed the little old gentleman must have been sitting there among them all the time, unnoticed.

""Judging from your talk this evening,"" continued the peak-faced little gentleman, ""you should welcome my offer. You seem to be exceptional people. You see the mistakes you've made: you understand the causes. The future hidden, you couldn't help yourselves. What I propose is to put you back twenty years. You will be young again, but with this difference: the knowledge of the future, as it relates to yourselves, will stay with you.

""Come,"" urged the old gentleman, ""the thing is quite simple. As a certain philosopher has proved: the universe is only the result of our perceptions. By what may seem to you magic—what will really be a chemical operation—I remove from your memory the events of the last twenty years, except what concerns your own personalities. You will keep all knowledge of the changes, physical and mental, that will come to you; all else will pass from your perception.""

The little old gentleman took a small bottle from his waistcoat pocket, and, filling a wine glass from a decanter, measured a few drops into it. Then he placed the glass in the center of the table.

""Youth is a good time to go back to,"" said the peak-faced little gentleman, with a smile. ""Twenty years ago, it was the night of the Hunt Ball. You remember it?""

It was Everett who drank first. He drank with his little twinkling eyes fixed hungrily on the proud handsome face of Mrs. Camelford; and then handed the glass to his wife. It was she who perhaps drank most eagerly. Her life with Everett, from the day when she had risen from a bed of sickness stripped of all her beauty, had been one bitter wrong. She drank with the hope that this might not be a dream; and thrilled to the touch of the man she loved, as reaching across the table he took the glass from her hand. Mrs. Armitage was the fourth to drink. She took the cup from her husband, drank with a quiet smile, and passed it on to Camelford. And Camelford drank, looking at no one, and put the glass back on the table.

""Come,"" said the little old gentleman to Mrs. Camelford, ""you are the only one left. The whole thing will be incomplete without you.""

""I have no wish to drink,"" said Mrs. Camelford, and her eyes sought those of her husband, but he would not look at her.

""Come,"" urged the figure again. And then Camelford looked at her and laughed drily.

""You’d better drink,"" he said. ""It's only a dream.""

""If you wish it,"" she answered. And it was from his hands she took the glass.

It is from the narrative as Armitage told it to me that night in the Club smoking-room that I am taking most of my material. It seemed to him that all things began slowly to rise upward, leaving him still, but with a great pain as though the inside of him were being torn away—like descending in a lift. But around him all the time was silence and darkness. After a period that might have been minutes or years, a faint light crept towards him. It grew stronger, and into the air which now fanned his cheek there came the sound of far-off music. The light and music both increased, and his senses returned to him. He was seated on a low cushioned bench beneath a group of palms. A young girl sat beside him, but her face was turned away.

""I did not catch your name,"" he was saying. ""Would you mind telling it to me?""

She turned her face towards him. It was the most spiritually beautiful face he had ever seen. ""I am in the same predicament,"" she laughed. ""You had better write yours on my program, and I will write mine on yours.""

So they wrote on each other's programs and exchanged them. The name she had written was Alice Blatchley.

He had never seen her before, that he remembered. Yet at the back of his mind there was a haunting knowledge of her. Somewhere long ago they had met, talked together. Slowly, as one recalls a dream, it came back to him. In some other life, vague, shadowy, he had married this woman. For the first few years they had loved each other; then the gulf had opened between them, widened. Stern, strong voices had called to him to lay aside his selfish dreams, his boyish ambitions, to take on a great duty. When he needed sympathy and help, this woman had fallen away from him. His ideals but irritated her. Only at the cost of daily bitterness had he been able to resist her efforts to draw him from his path. A face—that of a woman with soft eyes, full of helpfulness, shone through the mist of his dream—the face of a woman who would one day come to him out of the Future with outstretched hands that he would yearn to clasp.

""Shall we not dance?"" said the voice beside him. ""I really won't sit out a waltz.""

They hurried into the ballroom. With his arm around her form, her wondrous eyes shyly, at rare moments, seeking his, then vanishing again behind their drooping lashes, the brain, the mind, the very soul of the young man passed out of his own keeping. She complimented him in her charming manner, a delightful blend of condescension and timidity.

""You dance extremely well,"" she told him. ""You may ask me for another, later on.""

The words flashed out from that dim haunting future. ""Your dancing was your chief attraction for me, as likely as not, had I but known?""

All that evening and for many months to come the Present and the Future fought within him. And the experience of Nathaniel Armitage, divinity student, was the experience also of Alice Blatchley, who had fallen in love with him at first sight, having found him the best dancer she had ever whirled with to the music of the waltz; of Horatio Camelford, journalist and minor poet, whose journalism earned him a bare income, but at whose minor poetry critics smiled; of Jessica Dearwood, with her glorious eyes, and muddy complexion, and her hopeless passion for the big, handsome, ruddy-bearded Dick Everett, who, knowing it, only laughed at her in his kind, lordly way, telling her with frank bluntness that the woman who was not beautiful had missed her calling in life; of that clever young gentleman himself, who at twenty-five had already made his mark in the City, shrewd, clever, cool-headed as a fox, except where a pretty face and shapely hand or ankle were concerned; of Nellie Fanshawe, then in the pride of her ravishing beauty, who loved none but herself, whose idols were jewels, and fine dresses and rich feasts, the envy of other women and the courtship of all mankind.

That evening of the ball each clung to the hope that this memory of the future was just a dream. They had been introduced; had heard each other's names for the first time with a start of recognition; had avoided each other's eyes; had rushed into meaningless talk; till that moment when young Camelford, stooping to pick up Jessica's fan, had found that broken piece of the Rhenish wine-glass. Then conviction refused to be shaken off, and knowledge of the future had to be sadly accepted.

What they had not foreseen was that knowledge of the future in no way affected their emotions of the present. Nathaniel Armitage grew day by day more hopelessly in love with bewitching Alice Blatchley. The thought of her marrying anyone else—Camelford in particular—sent the blood boiling through his veins; added to which sweet Alice, with her arms about his neck, would confess to him that life without him would be a misery hardly to bear, that the thought of him as the husband of another woman—of Nellie Fanshawe in particular—was madness to her. It was right perhaps, knowing what they did, that they should say goodbye. She would bring sorrow into his life. Better far that he should put her away from him, that she should die of a broken heart, as she felt sure she would. How could he, a fond lover, inflict this suffering upon her? He ought of course to marry Nellie Fanshawe, but he could not stand the girl. Would it not be silly to marry a girl he strongly disliked because twenty years hence she might suit him better than the woman he now loved and who loved him?

Nor could Nellie Fanshawe bring herself to discuss without laughing the suggestion of marrying on a hundred-and-fifty a year a curate she hated. There would come a time when wealth would be indifferent to her, when her noble spirit would ask for self-sacrifice. But that time had not come. The emotions it would bring were unimaginable to her. Her whole being craved for the things of this world, the things within her grasp. To ask her to give them up now because later on she might not care for them! it was like telling a schoolboy to avoid the candy store because, when a man, the thought of sweets would be nauseous to him. If her capacity for enjoyment was to be short-lived, all the more reason for grasping joy quickly.

Alice Blatchley, when her lover was not by, gave herself many a headache trying to think logically. Was it not foolish of her to rush into this marriage with dear Nat? At forty she would wish she had married someone else. But most women at forty wished they had married someone else. If every girl at twenty listened to herself at forty there would be no more marriage. At forty she would be a different person altogether. That other elderly person did not interest her. To ask a young girl to spoil her life purely in the interests of this middle-aged party—it did not seem right. Besides, whom else was she to marry? Camelford would not have her; he did not want her then; he was not going to want her at forty. For practical purposes Camelford was out of the question. She might marry someone else altogether—and fare worse. She might remain a spinster: she hated the mere name of spinster. The inky-fingered woman journalist that, if all went well, she might become: it was not her idea. Was she acting selfishly? Ought she, for his own good, to refuse to marry dear Nat? Nellie—the little cat—who would suit him at forty, would not have him. If he was going to marry anyone but Nellie he might as well marry her, Alice. A bachelor clergyman! it sounded almost improper. Nor was dear Nat the type. If she threw him over it would be into the arms of some scheming woman. What was she to do?

Camelford at forty, influenced by favorable criticism, would have convinced himself he was a heaven-sent prophet, his life to be spent in saving mankind. At twenty he felt he wanted to live. Strange-looking Jessica, with her magnificent eyes hiding mysteries, was more important to him than the rest of humanity combined. Knowledge of the future in his case only spurred desire. The muddy complexion would grow pink and white, the thin limbs round and shapely; the now scornful eyes would one day light with love at his coming. It was what he had once hoped: it was what he now knew. At forty the artist is stronger than the man; at twenty the man is stronger than the artist.

An odd creature, so most folks would have described Jessica Dearwood. Few would have imagined her becoming the good-natured, easy-going Mrs. Camelford of middle age. The animal, so strong within her at twenty, at thirty had burnt itself out. At eighteen, madly, blindly in love with red-bearded, deep-voiced Dick Everett, she would, had he whistled to her, have flung herself at his feet, and this in spite of the knowledge forewarning her of the miserable life he would lead her, at least until her slowly developing beauty should give her the upper hand of him—by which time she would have come to despise him. Fortunately, as she told herself, he was not likely to do so, the future notwithstanding. Nellie Fanshawe's beauty held him as with chains of steel, and Nellie had no intention of letting her rich prize get away. Her own lover, it was true, irritated her more than any man she knew, but at least he would save her from charity. Jessica Dearwood, an orphan, had been brought up by a distant relative. She had not been the child to win affection. Of silent, brooding nature, every thoughtless incivility had been to her an insult, a wrong. Acceptance of young Camelford seemed her only escape from a life that had become to her a martyrdom. At forty-one he would wish he had been a bachelor; but at thirty-eight that would not trouble her. She would know herself he was much better off as he was. Meanwhile, she would have come to like him, to respect him. He would be famous, she would be proud of him. Crying into her pillow—for love of handsome Dick, it was still a comfort to reflect that Nellie Fanshawe, as it were, was watching over her, protecting her from herself.

Dick, as he muttered to himself a dozen times a day, ought to marry Jessica. At thirty-eight she would be his ideal. He looked at her as she was at eighteen, and shuddered. Nellie at thirty would be plain and uninteresting. But when did consideration of the future ever stop passion: when did a lover ever pause thinking of tomorrow? If her beauty was to quickly pass, was not that one reason the more urging him to have it while it lasted?

Nellie Fanshawe at forty would be a saint. The prospect did not please her: she hated saints. She would love the tiresome, solemn Nathaniel: of what use was that to her now? He did not desire her; he was in love with Alice, and Alice was in love with him. What would be the sense—even if they all agreed—in the three of them making themselves miserable for all their youth so they might be contented in their old age? Let age fend for itself and leave youth to its instincts. Let elderly saints suffer—it was their way—and youth drink the cup of life. It was a pity Dick was the only ""catch"" available, but he was young and handsome. Other girls had to put up with sixty and gout.

Another point, a very serious point, had been overlooked. All that had happened to them in that dim future of the past had happened to them as the results of their making the marriages they had made. To what fate other roads would lead their knowledge could not tell them. Nellie Fanshawe had become at forty a lovely character. Might not the hard life she had led with her husband—a life calling for continual sacrifice, for daily self-control—have helped towards this end? As the wife of a poor curate of high moral principles, would the same result have been secured? The fever that had robbed her of her beauty and turned her thoughts inward had been the result of sitting out on the balcony of the Paris Opera House with an Italian Count on the occasion of a fancy dress ball. As the wife of an East End clergyman, she might have escaped that fever and its purifying effects. Was there not danger in the position: a beautiful young woman, worldly-minded, hungry for pleasure, condemned to a life of poverty with a man she did not care for? The influence of Alice upon Nathaniel Armitage, during those first years when his character was forming, had been all for good. Could he be sure that, married to Nellie, he might not have deteriorated?

Were Alice Blatchley to marry an artist could she be sure that at forty she would still be in sympathy with artistic ideals? Even as a child had not her desire ever been in the opposite direction to that favored by her nurse? Did not the reading of Conservative journals invariably incline her towards Radicalism, and the steady stream of Radical talk round her husband's table invariably set her seeking arguments in favor of the feudal system? Might it not have been her husband's growing Puritanism that had driven her to crave for Bohemianism? Suppose that towards middle age, the wife of a wild artist, she suddenly ""took religion,"" as the saying is. Her last state would be worse than the first.

Camelford was of delicate physique. As an absent-minded bachelor with no one to give him his meals, no one to see that his things were aired, could he have lived till forty? Could he be sure that home life had not given more to his art than it had taken from it?

Jessica Dearwood, of a nervous, passionate nature, married to a bad husband, might at forty have posed for one of the Furies. Not until her life had become restful had her good looks shown themselves. Hers was the type of beauty that for its development demands tranquillity.

Dick Everett had no delusions concerning himself. That, had he married Jessica, he could for ten years have remained the faithful husband of a singularly plain wife he knew to be impossible. But Jessica would have been no patient Griselda. The extreme probability was that having married her at twenty for the sake of her beauty at thirty, at twenty-nine at latest she would have divorced him.

Everett was a man of practical ideas. It was he who took the matter in hand. The refreshment contractor admitted that curious goblets of German glass occasionally crept into their stock. One of the waiters, on the understanding that in no case should he be called upon to pay for them, admitted having broken more than one wine-glass on that particular evening: thought it not unlikely he might have attempted to hide the pieces under a convenient palm. The whole thing evidently was a dream. So youth decided at the time, and the three marriages took place within three months of each other.

It was some ten years later that Armitage told me the story that night in the Club smoking-room. Mrs. Everett had just recovered from a severe attack of rheumatic fever, caught the spring before in Paris. Mrs. Camelford, whom previously I had not met, certainly seemed to me one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. Mrs. Armitage—I knew her when she was Alice Blatchley—I found more charming as a woman than she had been as a girl. What she could have seen in Armitage I never could understand. Camelford made his mark some ten years later: poor fellow, he did not live long to enjoy his fame. Dick Everett has still another six years to work off; but he is well behaved, and there is talk of a petition.

It is a curious story altogether, I admit. As I said at the beginning, I do not myself believe it.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the tension between the characters' desires to rewrite their pasts and the realization that such changes may not lead to better outcomes. Six characters, each discontented with their current lives, are given the opportunity to return to their youth with the knowledge of how their lives will unfold. This proposition comes from a mysterious, peak-faced gentleman who offers to erase the last twenty years of their memories, leaving them only with the knowledge of their personal futures.

The dilemma they face is whether to act on this knowledge and alter their life choices—such as whom they marry—based on how they turned out in the ""future"" they remember. Each character has reasons to regret their current circumstances, yet they also understand that their experiences have shaped them into who they are. The story explores themes of fate, free will, and the unpredictability of human emotions. Despite the opportunity to change their destinies, the characters ultimately realize that knowledge of the future does not change their present emotions and desires, leading them to accept their original life paths.

This tension is compounded by the fact that, when they are alone, each character can dismiss the story as a hallucination. However, when they are together, the shared experience becomes undeniably real. This shared belief in the story creates a conflict between their logical minds and the emotional truth they experience together. The story raises questions about the nature of reality and whether it is shaped by individual perceptions or collective belief.",Imagine remembering a future where you regret your marriage—would you change partners if you could go back?,You've seen your future self unhappy.

Why or why not?,"The decision to drink from the goblet is questionable.

039.txt,"In December 1957, during a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand presented a paper titled ""On the Nature of the Solar S-Regions."" The title was so simple that the press overlooked its shocking implications. These implications are now discussed in an exclusive interview with Dr. Niemand by Philip Latham.

**LATHAM:** Dr. Niemand, what do you see as your main job?

**NIEMAND:** My main job is to find out everything I can about the connection between activity on the Sun and various activities on Earth.

**LATHAM:** What do you mean by activity on the Sun?

**NIEMAND:** Well, a sunspot is one type of solar activity.

**LATHAM:** What exactly is a sunspot?

**NIEMAND:** I can't say exactly what a sunspot is, but I can describe it. A sunspot is a cooler area on the Sun, which is why it looks dark. It’s not as hot, so it’s not as bright.

**LATHAM:** Isn't it true that the number of sunspots rises and falls in an eleven-year cycle?

**NIEMAND:** Yes, but it’s an *about* eleven-year cycle. That word *about* makes a difference.

**LATHAM:** How so?

**NIEMAND:** It means you can only roughly predict future sunspot activity. Sunspots are quite unpredictable.

**LATHAM:** Haven't there been many claims about sunspots affecting Earth?

**NIEMAND:** Yes, many claims.

**LATHAM:** What do you think of these claims?

**NIEMAND:** Most are nonsense.

**LATHAM:** But some are true?

**NIEMAND:** A few are. There is definitely a connection between sunspots and disturbances in Earth's magnetic field, radio fade-outs, auroras, and things like that.

**LATHAM:** I understand you’ve been exploring solar and terrestrial relationships in unusual ways.

**NIEMAND:** Yes, some might say that.

**LATHAM:** You’ve broken new ground?

**NIEMAND:** That's true.

**LATHAM:** How have your investigations differed from others?

**NIEMAND:** Our major breakthrough was finding that sunspots themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we’ve observed on Earth. It’s similar to how the red spots in measles aren’t the cause of the disease; the real cause is an invisible virus. In the solar case, it turned out to be these S-Regions.

**LATHAM:** Why S-Regions?

**NIEMAND:** We needed a name for them. They’re named after the Sun.

**LATHAM:** You say an S-Region is invisible?

**NIEMAND:** Yes, it’s invisible to the eye but can be detected by special instruments. However, it’s doubtful the radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects we see.

**LATHAM:** What are these effects?

**NIEMAND:** They’re common, as old as the world, but hard to describe accurately.

**LATHAM:** Can you give us a general idea?

**NIEMAND:** I’ll try. Remember the speech from ""Julius Caesar"" where Cassius is talking about the troubled times in ancient Rome? He says, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings."" Shakespeare would have been closer to the truth if he had said, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in ourselves but in our stars,"" or better, ""in the Sun.""

**LATHAM:** In the Sun?

**NIEMAND:** Yes, in the Sun. One of the oldest problems is understanding the source of human evil. Philosophers have struggled with it for ages and often given up, thinking it’s too deep for us to understand. They usually conclude that humans are inherently wicked and sinful. But now, for the first time, science has shed new light on this issue.

**LATHAM:** How so?

**NIEMAND:** Look at history. There are periods of calm and progress, then suddenly everything goes wrong. Wars start, people go mad, and the world descends into chaos.

**LATHAM:** But weren't there reasons for these events?

**NIEMAND:** What reasons?

**LATHAM:** Disputes over borders, economic rivalry, incidents at borders...

**NIEMAND:** Nonsense. People always find some excuse to go to war. The truth is, they go to war because they want to. They are driven by forces beyond their control.

**LATHAM:** Those are broad statements. Can you be more specific?

**NIEMAND:** Let me start from the beginning. It began in March 1955, when I started seeing patients with symptoms like severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mixed with episodes of rage. These people were disturbed, but not psychotic or deeply neurotic. They didn’t fit the typical picture and came from all walks of life. The attacks would start suddenly, and a week later, they’d be fine again.

**LATHAM:** Aren't such attacks typical of modern stress?

**NIEMAND:** The stress theory is overused. Even as a boy, I remember my grandfather, a country doctor, talking about the stress of modern life. But anthropologists have found that primitive people also suffer from similar conditions. It’s time to retire the stress theory.

**LATHAM:** Did you try tranquilizers?

**NIEMAND:** Yes, but only a few patients showed slight improvement. I don’t believe in giving random remedies. I asked my patients to keep a detailed record of their symptoms and the timing of their attacks.

**LATHAM:** Did this help?

**NIEMAND:** It was a start. Most patients said the attacks hit them like a physical blow. They felt uneasy, guilty, dizzy, or saw double before a wave of depression and rage hit them. As I studied these records, a pattern emerged.

**LATHAM:** What sort of pattern?

**NIEMAND:** The attacks happened during daylight, between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. And there were these coincidences—

**LATHAM:** Coincidences?

**NIEMAND:** Strangers miles apart were hit almost at the same time. At first, I thought it was chance, but the more records I collected, the more I saw it wasn’t. A mathematical analysis showed a distinct pattern. There was some evidence of mental patients acting up during a full moon, but nothing about the Sun.

**LATHAM:** What did you do?

**NIEMAND:** I didn’t tell my patients, but I stressed the importance of keeping an exact record of their attacks. The more records I got, the clearer the pattern became. People all over southern California were having simultaneous attacks. I then contacted an old colleague, Dr. Max Hillyard, in New York.

**LATHAM:** What happened?

**NIEMAND:** I thought he might think I was crazy, but he replied quickly, saying he had patients with the same symptoms. We found cases of simultaneous attacks three thousand miles apart.

**LATHAM:** How do you define ""simultaneous""?

**NIEMAND:** An attack is simultaneous if it occurs on the east coast no more than five minutes earlier or later than on the west coast. That's as precise as you can get with these symptoms. Another fact emerged: in every simultaneous attack, the Sun was shining at both locations.

**LATHAM:** If it was cloudy—

**NIEMAND:** No, I mean the Sun had to be above the horizon. Someone might have an attack after sunrise in New York, but not in California when it was dark, and vice versa. We realized the Sun was involved somehow.

**LATHAM:** That must have been puzzling.

**NIEMAND:** It was. It seemed like going back to the Middle Ages. But it was our only lead. Luckily, Hillyard knew a young astrophysicist, Henry Middletown, who was working on radio astronomy in Arizona. Without his help, our investigation would have stalled.

**LATHAM:** How did Middletown help?

**NIEMAND:** It’s a case of different fields not knowing what others are doing. We went to Arizona, worried Middletown wouldn’t take us seriously. But he listened carefully and asked to see our records. He worked on them and produced an amazing chart.

**LATHAM:** Can you describe the chart?

**NIEMAND:** It was simple. Middletown laid out squares on graph paper, dating them from March 1, 1955, when we started. He rated each day by the number and intensity of attacks. Then he added another row, dated twenty-seven days later, and continued until May 1958.

The squares with the highest numbers lined up in parallel series, showing a connection to the Sun.

**LATHAM:** How so?

**NIEMAND:** Because the solar rotation period is about twenty-seven days. If you see a spot on the Sun today, you might see it again twenty-seven days later. Middletown made another chart that night, even more convincing.

**LATHAM:** How was it more convincing?

**NIEMAND:** The lines on the first chart slanted slightly. On the second chart, dated twenty-seven point three days apart, the lines went straight down. This matched the solar rotation period perfectly.

**LATHAM:** How did you discover the S-Regions?

**NIEMAND:** Middletown noticed our chart looked like one he had plotted from radio observations. The patterns were similar, but the Earth disturbances started about two days later than the solar ones. Otherwise, they were almost identical.

**LATHAM:** If S-Regions are invisible, how did he find them?

**NIEMAND:** They’re invisible to the eye but detectable by radio telescopes. Middletown discovered them in Australia and continued his research in Arizona. An S-Region is announced by bursts of radiation lasting a few seconds.

**LATHAM:** You said mental disturbances last ten to twelve days. How does that relate to S-Regions?

**NIEMAND:** It takes about twelve days for an S-Region to cross the Sun, since the rotation period is twenty-seven point three days.

**LATHAM:** I’d think it’d be thirteen or fourteen days.

**NIEMAND:** Apparently, an S-Region isn’t very effective when it’s just appearing or disappearing on the Sun.

**LATHAM:** Are S-Regions related to sunspots?

**NIEMAND:** They’re connected in that more sunspots mean more S-Region activity. But there’s no one-to-one match between a sunspot and an S-Region or between sunspots and magnetic storms.

**LATHAM:** Why?

**NIEMAND:** We don’t know.

**LATHAM:** What else have you discovered about S-Regions?

**NIEMAND:** Middletown says their radio waves are strongly polarized. The rotation stays constant as one crosses the Sun. If the magnetic field extends high into the solar corona, the rotation matches the magneto-ionic theory.

**LATHAM:** Does this mean mental disturbances are caused by electromagnetic radiation?

**NIEMAND:** We doubt it. The charts show a forty-eight-hour delay between an S-Region forming and mental disturbances starting. This suggests the energy is a type of corpuscular radiation, which we haven’t identified yet.

**LATHAM:** Why are some people affected by S-Regions and others not?

**NIEMAND:** We think everyone is affected to some degree. Why some are more affected is still unknown.

**LATHAM:** How long does an S-Region last?

**NIEMAND:** They can last three to twelve solar rotations before dying out. Then a new one may appear elsewhere on the Sun. Sometimes several are active at once.

**LATHAM:** Why weren’t S-Regions discovered earlier?

**NIEMAND:** Because solar radio exploration only began after World War II.

**LATHAM:** Why did you only start getting patients in 1955?

**NIEMAND:** We probably saw them before, but not in large enough numbers to notice. Also, the sunspot cycle began rising to a maximum in 1954.

**LATHAM:** Is there no way to escape S-radiation?

**NIEMAND:** The only sure way is to stay on the dark side of Earth, which is hard to do. The beam from an S-Region is wide and felt across entire continents. Hillyard and Middletown are working on shielding but haven’t succeeded yet.

**LATHAM:** What’s the current state of S-Region activity?

**NIEMAND:** Right now, there’s no S-Region activity, but a new one could start anytime. The outlook isn’t good. Sunspot activity is high and getting more violent. The last cycle was the highest since 1780, and the current cycle might set a new record.

**LATHAM:** So you believe S-Regions cause much of the world's trouble, that it’s not us but something outside us—

**NIEMAND:** That’s what our investigation suggests. We’re controlled by forces we often can’t resist.

**LATHAM:** Couldn’t we be warned of an S-Region?

**NIEMAND:** They develop randomly, so a warning system might be useless. We’d be crying WOLF! all the time.

**LATHAM:** How might someone know an S-Region is active if they’re not very susceptible?

**NIEMAND:** If you feel restless and anxious, can’t concentrate, feel depressed, or resentful, it might mean an S-Region is active. Be careful with yourself. It seems evil will always be with us as long as the Sun shines on our world.

THE END",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the discovery and implications of S-Regions on the Sun and their effect on human behavior. Dr. Niemand's research suggests that these solar phenomena might be linked to periods of unrest and chaos on Earth, challenging the long-held belief that human behavior is solely a result of internal or societal factors. The dilemma arises from the potential realization that much of what is considered human evil or madness might be driven by external, cosmic forces beyond human control.

This revelation conflicts with traditional views of human nature and responsibility, as it posits that people might be influenced by something as distant and uncontrollable as solar activity. The story explores the tension between scientific discovery and its unsettling implications for understanding human behavior, raising questions about free will, accountability, and the extent to which humans can resist these external influences.",Imagine wars and madness on Earth being caused by invisible forces from the Sun.

040.txt,"The story is called ""Diplomatic Immunity"" by Robert Sheckley. It starts with the Ambassador inviting Colonel Cercy and some other men into a special room the State Department gave him. Cercy is trying to judge this alien Ambassador who has all of Washington worried because he claims to represent a huge empire that stretches across the galaxy. The Ambassador invites Earth to join their organization, but Cercy and his team are suspicious since it sounds like there might not be a choice.

Cercy is in charge of the situation and has a gun ready in case things go wrong. The Ambassador explains that he and others like him explore space for intelligent life, and once they find it, they send a signal back to their people. Cercy asks the Ambassador to stop sending the signal because Earth doesn't want to join their empire, but the Ambassador says he can't stop it. He also warns that trying to kill him won't work because he has a special kind of diplomatic immunity.

The team tries everything they can think of to kill the Ambassador. They shoot at him, set the room on fire, flood it with radiation, and even try to use bacteria. Nothing works. The Ambassador explains that his defense is to become whatever is attacking him, like turning into fire when they try to burn him.

Cercy and the team are stumped, and Cercy starts to get desperate. They try psychological tactics and even bring in wild animals to attack him, but nothing gets through his defense. Meanwhile, Darrig, one of the team members, is working on a theory about what the Ambassador might be vulnerable to.

Finally, Darrig comes up with the idea that the Ambassador can't handle chaos. He remembers the Greek myth about Medusa, who could turn people to stone if they looked at her. Darrig believes that chaos is something the Ambassador can't adapt to, just like no one could look at Medusa. They use machines to create a state of chaos in the Ambassador's room, and it works. The Ambassador is unable to handle it and disappears.

Though they've dealt with the Ambassador, Cercy knows there’s still a fleet of aliens heading for Earth, looking for them. They have to start thinking about how to hide an entire planet.

That's how the story ends, with Cercy realizing they might have won this round, but the bigger challenge is still ahead.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""Diplomatic Immunity"" by Robert Sheckley revolves around Earth's struggle to assert its autonomy against a seemingly unstoppable alien force intent on incorporating Earth into its vast galactic empire. This conflict manifests through the interactions between Colonel Cercy and the alien Ambassador, who represents a civilization with advanced diplomatic and defensive capabilities. Cercy's primary dilemma is how to stop the Ambassador from signaling his empire to integrate Earth, especially since traditional and extraordinary means of force are ineffective against the Ambassador due to his unique form of diplomatic immunity.

The core of the conflict lies in the clash between Earth's desire for sovereignty and the Ambassador's mission to include Earth in his empire, which poses an existential threat to Earth's autonomy. Cercy and his team's efforts to neutralize the Ambassador highlight the tension between human ingenuity and the advanced, seemingly invincible nature of the alien technology.

Ultimately, the resolution of this immediate conflict through the introduction of chaos as a weapon reveals a temporary victory for Cercy and his team. However, it also introduces a new layer of conflict, as the impending arrival of the alien fleet suggests that Earth's struggle for independence is far from over. The story ends on a note of uncertainty, with Cercy contemplating the daunting task of concealing an entire planet from a powerful alien civilization.","You're told Earth must join a galactic empire, and saying ""no"" isn’t an option.

041.txt,"At half-past eight, they left the town. The road was dry, and the April sun was warm, but patches of snow still lay in the ditches and woods. Winter was only just over, and spring had come suddenly. But the sun and the bright woods, the birds flying over the puddles, and the marvelous sky brought no joy to Marya Vassilyevna. She was sitting in the cart, feeling nothing new or interesting. For thirteen years she had been a schoolmistress, and she couldn't count how many times she'd made this journey for her salary. Whether it was spring, autumn, or winter, it was all the same to her, and she always wished for one thing only: to reach her destination quickly.

It felt like she had been living there forever, for a hundred years. She knew every stone and tree on the road. Her past, present, and future were all tied to the school and the road to town. She had forgotten her life before becoming a schoolmistress—her life in Moscow, her parents, and her brother. Her father's photo was the only thing left, but it had faded.

After a couple of miles, old Semyon, who was driving, said, ""They caught a government clerk in town. He killed Alexeyev, the Mayor, with some Germans in Moscow.""

""Who told you that?"" Marya asked.

""They read it in the paper at Ivan Ionov’s tavern.""

They were silent for a long time. Marya thought about her school and the upcoming examination. She was sending a girl and four boys for it. Just then, Hanov, a neighboring landowner, overtook her in a carriage. He had been the examiner at her school the year before.

""Good-morning,"" he said. ""You're driving home, I suppose.""

Hanov was forty, handsome, and admired by women. People said he drank heavily and did nothing but walk up and down whistling or play chess. His papers at the exam had smelled of wine and scent, but he was courteous, giving only the highest marks.

""I'm visiting Bakvist,"" Hanov said, ""but I hear he's not home.""

Hanov led the way into a village road, and Semyon followed. The horses struggled through the mud, and Marya thought about the exam questions. The Zemstvo board had been unhelpful, ignoring her requests to dismiss the lazy, rude watchman. She was annoyed with the officials who were always unavailable.

""He really is handsome,"" she thought, glancing at Hanov.

The road worsened, and they entered the woods. Twigs struck their faces as they passed.

""What a road!"" Hanov laughed.

Marya couldn't understand why Hanov lived there. Why endure the mud and discomfort when he could live in Petersburg or abroad? He seemed kind and naive, not understanding the coarse life. He subscribed to schools, thinking himself helpful, but what use were his globes here?

""Hold on, Vassilyevna!"" Semyon shouted.

The cart lurched violently. Marya's feet were cold and wet. The girl and four boys at her school, the exam, the watchman, and the Zemstvo mixed in her thoughts with spring, Hanov's eyes, and the happiness she would never have.

His wife? Her life was cold and comfortless, children tracking in mud and noise. Her head ached daily, and she struggled with heartburn. Collecting money for wood, begging the guardian for help, and dreaming of exams filled her days. She feared people and used formal expressions, and no one found her attractive. Life passed without affection or interesting acquaintances. How awful if she had fallen in love!

""Hold on, Vassilyevna!""

Another sharp ascent. She had become a schoolmistress out of necessity, not vocation. Teachers, doctors, and assistants had no comfort of serving an idea, always thinking of daily bread, wood, bad roads, and illnesses. Only silent, patient cart-horses like her could endure it long; lively people soon gave up.

Semyon picked the driest way, but they often had to turn back. They reached Nizhneye Gorodistche. The tavern was full of drivers. Marya sat down for tea, while peasants drank vodka and beer, perspiring and noisy.

""Stay, old man,"" voices shouted. ""Young lady, we know her; she's a good one.""

The swing-door banged as people came and went. Marya drank tea, thinking of firewood and the watchman.

""Vassilyevna, get ready,"" Semyon called.

They set off again, slowly.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around Marya Vassilyevna's internal struggle with monotony and dissatisfaction in her life. As a schoolmistress in a rural area, she experiences a profound sense of stagnation and unfulfillment. Her journey to town for her salary, a routine she has followed countless times over thirteen years, symbolizes the repetitive and unchanging nature of her existence. Despite the changing seasons and the natural beauty around her, Marya feels disconnected and emotionally numb.

Her life is consumed by mundane responsibilities and frustrations, like dealing with unhelpful officials and a lazy watchman, as well as the constant worry about her students' examinations. She reflects on her lost connections to her past life in Moscow and her family, which adds to her sense of isolation.

The encounter with Hanov, the neighboring landowner, introduces a brief moment of contrast. Hanov, with his handsome appearance and carefree demeanor, represents a different, more vibrant world that Marya feels she cannot access. This interaction highlights her longing for something more, yet she is painfully aware of the barriers that prevent her from pursuing happiness or meaningful change.

Ultimately, Marya's conflict is between her acceptance of a life that feels predetermined and the faint, unfulfilled desire for affection, change, and a sense of purpose. She embodies the silent endurance of someone who has resigned to her circumstances, akin to the patient cart-horses she admires, yet she is haunted by the possibilities of what her life could have been.",Imagine living the same day over and over for 13 years—would you break away or stay stuck like Marya?,"If your work became your whole life, would you accept it or fight for something more, like Marya wishes?","What if your life's purpose was lost, buried beneath daily struggles and the weight of routine?",historical fiction,tragedy,coming of age,What is Marya Vassilyevna's job?,Marya Vassilyevna is a schoolmistress.,Why does Marya feel like she has been living the same life forever?,"Marya feels like she has been living the same life forever because her routine is monotonous and unchanging, tied to her job and the road she travels frequently.",How does the weather reflect Marya's feelings?,"The weather, with its patches of snow and sudden spring, reflects Marya's feelings of stagnation and lack of joy, as she feels indifferent to the changing seasons.",What does Hanov represent in Marya's life?,"Hanov represents a contrast to Marya's life; he is handsome, admired, and seemingly carefree, highlighting the lack of excitement and affection in Marya's own life.",Do you think Marya is satisfied with her life?

042.txt,"Reuben, a man from the eighty-third level and an Atomist, noticed something was wrong when the binoculars he was using suddenly flashed and went dark. He was worried but tried not to show it. He gave the binoculars back to Almon, a Maintainer from the eighty-ninth level, with a smile.

""They aren't very good,"" Reuben said.

Almon checked them and agreed, offering another pair. As Reuben looked through the new binoculars at the city of Denv below, he tried to figure out what was going on without letting Almon know he was suspicious.

""Can we...?"" Reuben asked, hinting at leaving.

""It's better not to,"" Almon replied quickly. ""What if someone important saw us? How would you feel if someone was looking at you like that?""

Reuben pretended to be insulted and laughed along with Almon. They talked about how maybe one day they would see the view from the higher levels.

Reuben left and went back down to his own level, where his friend Selene was waiting. She was dressed nicely, which made Reuben cautious. Selene was with Griffin, but she seemed interested in Reuben.

""You belong up there,"" Selene said, talking about the higher levels. ""Griffin doesn't believe in you, but I do.""

Reuben was careful with his response and moved on. He wondered what Selene wanted and what was going on with the binoculars.

Suddenly, an attack alarm blared. Reuben hid under a table in a nearby room. Another person joined him, and a third tried to squeeze in. The first person, who turned out to be General May, told the third to find their own shelter.

Reuben, realizing he was with someone important, offered to leave, but General May let him stay. They talked, and Reuben learned that someone might be trying to replace him with a double. May explained that the binoculars were used to take a picture of his eyes, and it was part of a plan by a rival, Rudolph.

Reuben and May discussed what to do. May saw potential in Reuben and hinted at a possible future task for him. Later, Selene came to Reuben's room, trying to distract him for the double's arrival. Reuben realized this and confronted her. She admitted that she was promised better things by Almon if she helped.

When the double came in, Reuben was ready and stopped him. He and Selene covered up what happened, planning to pretend the double had succeeded. Reuben was determined to rise in the ranks and achieve a better life.

The next day, Reuben was taken to see the leaders of Denv. He was accused of being a spy, but when they checked, it turned out he was innocent. General May had outsmarted Rudolph, who had tried to frame Reuben.

May told Reuben about his dreams of peace with Ellay and a better future for Denv. Reuben appeared to support May's vision, but later he went to Rudolph and betrayed May, saying May was insane.

045.txt,"Once upon a time, the Queen of Fairyland got bored because her fairy subjects were all too well-behaved. She decided she wanted a couple of real humans at her court for some excitement. After looking around, she chose two humans to bring to Fairyland.

But how would they get them there?

""Please, your majesty,"" said the prime minister's daughter, Peaseblossom, ""I can bring the girl.""

Peaseblossom looked so graceful and shy that the Queen agreed right away.

""How will you do it, Peaseblossom?"" asked the Queen.

""I will open the road before her and close it behind her,"" Peaseblossom replied.

""I've heard you have clever ways of doing things, so you may try,"" said the Queen.

The court was being held in a forest glade, and there was just one molehill in the middle. As soon as the Queen gave Peaseblossom permission, a goblin's head popped up from the molehill and shouted, ""Please, your majesty, I will bring the boy.""

""You?"" the Queen exclaimed. ""How will you do it?""

The goblin, named Toadstool, wriggled out of the ground like a snake, making everyone laugh. Then he rolled over and over until he disappeared into the woods. The courtiers followed him, laughing until they left the Queen alone on her throne.

When they reached the woods, Toadstool was nowhere to be found. But soon, his head popped up from the molehill again, and he said, ""So, your majesty.""

""You took your time,"" laughed the Queen.

""And my own way too, eh, your majesty?"" replied Toadstool, grinning.

""Well, you may try,"" said the Queen, and Toadstool, making a half-bow, disappeared back into the earth.

CHAPTER II

No one knows exactly where Fairyland begins or ends, but somewhere on its borders, there was a nice country village with nice country people.

Alice was the squire's daughter, a pretty and good-natured girl. One rosy summer evening, she lay on her bed, looking at the wall, which was glowing with the colors of the sunset. As the color faded, Alice sighed and wished it was always sunset.

""I will take you where the sun is always setting, if you like, Alice,"" said a small, sweet voice.

Alice looked down and saw a lovely little creature standing on her bed. It seemed perfectly natural for the little lady to be there. She was dressed in white with a sunset-red cloak, like a sweet pea, and wore a crown of twisted tendrils with a tiny gold beetle in front.

""Are you a fairy?"" asked Alice.

""Yes. Will you come with me to the sunset?"" asked the fairy.

""Yes, I will,"" said Alice.

When Alice got up, she found she was no bigger than the fairy. As she walked towards Peaseblossom, she stumbled over what she thought were tufts on the bedspread. But soon, she realized she was walking on bushes of furze and heather.

""Where are we?"" asked Alice.

""Going on,"" answered the fairy.

Alice didn't like the answer and said, ""I want to go home.""

""Goodbye, then!"" answered the fairy.

But Alice couldn't tell which way home was, so she said, ""I must go with you, I see.""

They walked until they reached a meadow with a little stream running through it. As they went on, the stream became wider and gentler, leading them into a forest of poplar trees growing out of the water. The stream turned into a lake, and Peaseblossom led Alice straight through it.

It was dark under the water, but everything glowed with a pale light. Alice saw flowers like primroses and violets growing underwater. When they swam through a deep pool, Alice felt dry even though the water was wet.

As they went on, the moon rose, casting a misty light over everything. The fairy lady gathered some poppies and gave them to Alice, telling her to throw them into the next pool. Alice did so, and laying her head on the poppies, she began to sink. She felt herself lying on the grass at the bottom of the pool, looking up at the sleepy moon, and fell fast asleep, dreaming of home.

CHAPTER III

Richard was the son of a widow in Alice's village. He was poor and shy, so he mostly stayed home reading books. He was saving up to buy an umbrella for his mother because hers was falling apart.

One summer evening, he saw an odd little man selling umbrellas in the market. The man was asking such low prices that no one dared buy one. Richard approached, thinking an umbrella that could lay eggs would be great.

After everyone left, Richard followed the umbrellas, which turned out to be black geese, down a lane. He caught one, but it turned into a hedgehog in his hands. The geese flew into the woods, but Richard chased them and found them hanging from trees, with a turkey-cock leading them.

The turkey turned out to be Toadstool, who said, ""Go home, Richard.""

""Not for your bidding,"" replied Richard.

Toadstool offered him an umbrella for his mother, but Richard refused to take gifts from strangers. Then Toadstool rolled to the top of a hill, cut gashes in some palm trees, and a stream began to flow from them.

Toadstool made a leaf boat for Richard, and they rode the stream through meadows and over hills. The water carried them faster and faster until they plunged into a lake. Toadstool disappeared, and Richard fell asleep in the rocking boat.

CHAPTER IV

When Richard woke, he was alone on the lake. Looking down, he saw Alice at the bottom. But when she floated up, she refused his help.

Alice asked how Richard got there, and he said a goblin brought him. Peaseblossom floated over to him, saying she would take him to the court while Toadstool took Alice.

Richard didn't want to leave Alice, and when Alice cried out, he jumped to her side. He hit Toadstool, who disappeared underwater.

Peaseblossom floated away, leaving Richard and Alice alone. Alice was upset that Richard drove away her fairy.

Richard suggested they swim from tree to tree until they found one big enough to climb. They climbed a huge tree until they found a branch to rest on.

They met an owl reading a book upside down. Richard asked it the way out, and the owl said down the stairs. Richard didn't trust the owl, but they followed a staircase down into a hall with many pillars.

Alice, frightened by the silence, held Richard's arm. They found a door leading into a dark passage. When Alice spoke kindly to Richard, he began to see light coming from Alice's face. They could see each other's path and walked between two black waters.

When the path ended, Richard carried Alice through the water, which was full of strange creatures. They reached a rock wall with steps leading up.

At the top, Richard knocked on a stone. A voice above growled and told them to go down. Richard pushed the stone, upsetting an old man's pot and cat. Richard and Alice climbed out and found themselves in the old man's house.

The old man made them sit apart. Richard, thinking it was a trick, stabbed the mountain, revealing it was the cat. The cat vanished, and Richard and Alice left the house.

They found themselves in a beautiful hall. Alice got lost exploring a side room, and Richard followed her voice to a tower door. He convinced her to jump, and they found themselves outside a familiar cottage.

They ran home, and Richard said goodbye to Alice at her gate. Alice was sad to part, but they knew they must.

As Richard walked home, he saw the umbrella-man selling the last umbrella. He thought about punching him but remembered how it didn't work on the goblin.

As a reward for their bravery, the Fairy Queen allowed them to visit Fairyland whenever they pleased. Peaseblossom and Toadstool were banished to live in an old tree for seven years.

THE SHADOWS

Old Ralph Rinkelmann made a living drawing funny pictures, but he almost lost it all with his serious poems. So, he was the perfect person to be chosen king of the fairies, as fairy sovereignty is elective.

It might seem strange that fairies would want a human king, but they believe some humans are greater than they are. So, when enough fairies think this way, someone like Ralph Rinkelmann gets chosen.

They didn't intend to make him stay in Fairyland all the time. They needed him only for special occasions. But they had to get him there first. They could only take grown-ups to Fairyland when they were between life and death.

Luckily, Ralph fell very ill, and while he hovered between life and death, the fairies carried him off and made him their king. But because of his illness, he couldn't quite manage to sit upright on the throne.

The gnomes and goblins took advantage and played all sorts of tricks on him. But after much effort, Ralph got them in order, and they vanished back to their holes. When he came to, he found himself in bed with Mrs. Rinkelmann taking care of him.

The room was full of strange creatures, which he thought were goblins, but they were different. They seemed to be his subjects, and he needed to learn about them.

These creatures were the Shadows, and they wanted Ralph to know them better. They were not foolish but had their own ways. Ralph agreed to listen to them.

The Shadows explained they were worried about their existence. The artificial lights in towns made them nearly invisible. They wanted Ralph to help restore their place in homes and hearts.

Ralph was curious and promised to come back the next night to learn more about them. The Shadows vanished, leaving Ralph to think about what he'd seen.

The next night, after Mrs. Rinkelmann left the room, the Shadows returned and carried Ralph to their church in Iceland. There, Ralph saw a gathering of Shadows, each telling stories of their adventures.

Ralph listened to many stories, some of which made him laugh, others made him cry. He learned about the Shadows' roles in people's lives, sometimes helping them realize truths, sometimes saving them from harm.

As the night went on, Ralph began to see stranger Shadows with human faces. He realized they were different from the others, but he didn't know what they were.

Before he could learn more, the moon rose, and the Shadows vanished. Ralph found himself back in his room, with one of his children by his side.

Ralph was glad to be a man and not a Shadow. He realized that while Shadows might seem mysterious, they were only what they were—Shadows. And he was comforted by this thought.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around the Fairy Queen's desire to bring excitement to her court by introducing real humans into Fairyland, which leads to the abduction of two humans, Alice and Richard. This decision sets off a chain of events involving the fairies Peaseblossom and Toadstool, who are tasked with bringing Alice and Richard to Fairyland. The story explores the challenges and adventures that Alice and Richard face as they are brought into this magical world, their desire to return home, and their interactions with the fairy creatures.

The underlying conflict is the tension between the whimsical desires of the Fairy Queen and the fairies' playful, sometimes mischievous nature, against the backdrop of Alice and Richard's struggle to navigate and eventually escape the unfamiliar and enchanting world of Fairyland. This conflict is resolved when Alice and Richard manage to find their way back home, with the Fairy Queen granting them the ability to visit Fairyland whenever they please, while Peaseblossom and Toadstool face consequences for their actions.

Additionally, there is a secondary, more philosophical conflict in Ralph Rinkelmann's story, where he grapples with understanding the Shadows and their concerns about their existence in a world increasingly illuminated by artificial lights.

046.txt,"They lived by and for push buttons and machines, and knew nothing else. But Endicott remembered about the old, old days—when a man could save a life without a push-button....

Stiff fingers of icy, wind-driven snow beat on the hull of the cargo ship, filtering through the jagged tears in the metal skin and settling over the useless control board with its dead gauges and rows of pushbuttons. A branch, thrashed by the wind, screeched against the ship's hull, echoing through the interior like the rasp of sliding hatch covers.

Dazed, Allison watched the snow settle on the buttons, each one acquiring a strange, cone-shaped hat of snow. He reached out with a stiffening finger and brushed one of the hats away, only to see another form in its place.

""Come on, Allison, come on. Snap out of it."" Endicott came from the passageway into the control room, back from checking the machinery. ""You hurt in the landing?""

Allison didn't answer. He shivered and pushed another finger at the control board; he pressed a button, but nothing happened. No hidden relay clicked, no motors sprang to life.

""You can push that button or any of the others all you want—It won't do any good. We're dead."" Endicott's frozen breath drifted over Allison's shoulder, merging with the falling snow.

""Dead?"" Allison echoed, his voice like a sleepwalker's. ""Dead,"" he repeated, jabbing the button again and again.

""In a manner of speaking,"" Endicott frowned. ""We're off the powercast—our receiver, I guess.""

""No power."" Allison was waking up. ""That means—Can't you fix it, Chief?""

""Nope. I tried, but something's burned out. No power."" Endicott rubbed his old hands together.

Allison's frost-numbed fingers fumbled with the straps on his seat, and he stepped onto the light metal deck. He shivered and pressed the button on the control board again, seized by uncontrollable shaking. ""No power means—no heat!"" Panic crept into his voice.

Endicott said nothing but looked at the rows of buttons, now useless.

Allison looked too, his shoulders hunched. ""They've never failed before,"" he muttered through chattering teeth.

""What?"" Endicott seemed puzzled.

""The buttons. You press them, and you always get what you want—except now!""

""Now, now,"" Endicott said soothingly. ""Panic won't help us. All we have to do is sit tight—and wait. They'll send a relief ship out—""

""When?""

""In the morning. Morning, sure. They had us on the 'viewer, don't forget. They'll know exactly where to look.""

""They won't find us in this white stuff.""

""I tell you they know precisely where we are. And anyway, the scanviewer will pick us up.""

""I don't think they'll ever find us."" Allison slumped down on his seat, staring wide-eyed at the snow drift slowly forming inside the control room. ""This white stuff scares me."" He shivered, then got up quickly, his boots slipping on the slick decking, and punched the button again. ""It's got to work!"" he cried and beat on the board with his fist.

""Stop that!"" Endicott said sharply.

There was a slap in the control room, then silence.

In a moment Endicott said in his soothing voice, ""Sorry, Allison. Everything'll be all right. Don't worry.""

""If you say so, Chief."" Allison stood in the center of the control room, his arms slack by his sides.

""We'll be all right,"" Endicott said. ""We have food capsules—""

""Sure, Chief.""

""We'll be all right, except—"" Endicott peered through the rents in the hull into the storm outside. ""All we have to do is sit tight,"" he added quickly.

""We'll freeze tonight without heat."" Allison's voice was still edged with panic.

""Yeah. Yeah, I've been thinking about that. There's something deep in my mind—something I can't quite grasp—"" Endicott still looked out at the storm-thrashed trees, a puzzled expression on his face. ""Something from my childhood—I was born a long time before you, you know, before they set up state conditioning homes for children. Long before they set up this 'everything-from-buttons' business. Lived with my own people, I did, and I seem to remember—seem to remember—"" His puzzled expression became one of concentration. ""Or maybe it was something I read a long time ago,"" he mused.

""Did what?"" Allison perked up.

""Read. You wouldn't know what that was. Everything comes from buttons now, entertainment, food, light, heat—everything.... No, it was from my childhood, I'm sure. I remember my people used to take me out in the country—"" Endicott mused on while snow grew on the shoulders of his jacket, and the light began to fade.

""Out in the country? What for? Nobody goes out there."" Allison's eyes gleamed slightly in the growing dusk.

""—for picnics. And—"" Endicott's eyes brightened, and one hand clenched.

""For what?"" Allison's head thrust forward.

""What?"" Endicott snapped, irritated at having his train of thought broken.

""What did your people take you in the country for?""

""A picnic.... Yes, yes, that's it! I remember now!"" Endicott's words poured out.

""You know it is forbidden to think of the old days.""

""Shut up! Let me think. You want heat, don't you?""

""It's forbidden to think of the old days,"" Allison repeated stubbornly. ""You'll get heat when I report this—in a different way.""

""Shut up! Look, you want to keep from freezing tonight?"" Endicott glared. ""All right. Come with me and do as I say."" Without a backward glance Endicott crossed the slippery deck and entered the passageway. At the midship cargo hatch, he stopped.

""How are you going to open it without power?"" Allison's breath shot over Endicott's shoulder. ""It's locked and unlocked by a button on the control board. Remember, Chief?""

""Stop gloating, Allison. This is for your benefit as well as mine. There's an escape hatch in the control room.""

""That's controlled by power, too.""

""Yes, but in these older models, the hatch also has a manual control, as I remember."" Endicott moved off toward the control room.

Allison hesitated, then followed, and joined Endicott as he began to search the control board. Endicott found the emergency lever for the escape hatch and tugged on it, turning his head to watch the hatch in the side of the hull, back of his seat. The hatch, big enough for one man to pass through at a time, popped, crackling with frost, and stirred slightly.

""Now, Allison, my boy, let's put our shoulders to it."" Endicott was in high spirits again.

As soon as the hatch swung open, Endicott put his head and shoulders through the opening, squinting his eyes against the icy snow swirling past him. He grabbed a handhold on the outside of the hull and pulled his legs through, dropping into the snow alongside the ship.

Allison's head and shoulders appeared in the opening, and in a moment he was beside Endicott. ""Now what?"" Allison yelled above the wind.

Endicott looked toward the clearing in which they had landed, then turned to face the trees around the disabled ship. He waded through the snow to the nearest one and took hold of a dry branch over his head, tugging it several times before snapping it off.

""Now, Allison, you see what I did? Well, you do the same, only gather an armload of branches. When you have them, bring them to me at the ship. And keep on gathering them until I tell you to stop.""

Allison stood still in the deep snow, peering suspiciously at Endicott through the snow-swirl. ""Is this something from the old—?""

""Never mind that now, Allison,"" Endicott said patiently. ""Let's not worry about all that. You want to be warm, don't you? So, just do as I say.""

Allison's eyebrows shot up and lowered instantly, and his face set in stubborn planes. ""If this is from the old days, I'm not sure I want any part of it."" He looked over his shoulders at the gloomy woods.

""There are no Conditioning Committees here, Allison,"" Endicott said testily. ""Get on with it.""

Allison took a few reluctant steps toward the nearest tree. Endicott started back to the ship with his branch, looking back over his shoulder.

""No, no, Allison. See those green needles? It won't do at all. Dry branches, Allison, dry branches."" The wind carried Endicott's words over the few yards.

""I can't see how these—branches?—are going to keep us warm. It seems like a lot of useless trouble getting them,"" Allison said sulkily, suspicion and fear unabated.

Endicott didn't answer. Instead, he went to the side of the ship away from the wind and began packing the snow down into a flat, hard surface. He broke his branch into short lengths over his knee, then, in a nearly forgotten gesture, slapped at his uniform until he remembered that he had no pockets. For a moment he stood still, his eyes roving over the side of the ship until they came to one of the jagged tears. With a little self-congratulatory chuckle, he began scraping one of the lengths of wood over the torn metal, catching the splinters and shavings in the palm of one hand.

Allison dropped his armload of branches by the ship, battled between fear of the unknown and curiosity in which curiosity won, and stood watching Endicott arrange the branches in a crib around the neatly piled shavings. Endicott, on one knee by the crib, worked steadily, laying the pieces of wood with care and a returning sense of surety, with only brief pauses to flex his freezing fingers. Finally, with a smile of satisfaction, Endicott got to his feet, and the nearly forgotten gesture at the pocketless uniform was repeated.

Slowly, Endicott's lined face changed. He looked hastily at the watchful Allison and quickly looked away; he looked at the completed crib, and his tongue licked his lips; he looked along the side of the damaged ship, and his eyes narrowed thoughtfully; finally, he looked into the swirl of the icy snow, and he shivered. His hands stopped their pawing, fell slowly, to hang slack by his sides. He was not smiling as he turned away.

""What were you looking for?"" Allison asked curiously.

""I just remembered something else,"" said Endicott, his voice very soft in the stillness, ""we used to have something called a match to start those picnic fires.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around survival in a world that has become overly reliant on technology and automation. The characters, Endicott and Allison, find themselves in a dire situation after their cargo ship crashes and they lose access to the power that operates their technology-driven environment. The pushbuttons and machines they depend on for heat, light, and survival have failed, and they are left in a snowstorm with no power or heat.

The dilemma is compounded by Allison's fear and skepticism of Endicott's old-world knowledge and methods. Endicott remembers a time before the reliance on pushbuttons, when people had to perform tasks manually, such as starting a fire with matches. However, Allison has been conditioned to believe that the old ways are forbidden and untrustworthy. This creates a tension between the need to survive and the ingrained distrust of non-technological solutions.

The story explores themes of dependency on technology, the loss of basic survival skills, and the conflict between old and new ways of thinking. Endicott's struggle to recall and implement traditional methods of survival is juxtaposed against Allison's conditioned skepticism, highlighting the broader societal conflict of losing touch with fundamental skills in the face of technological advancement.",**What would you do if the buttons that controlled your world suddenly stopped working?**,"**In a snowstorm, would you risk using forbidden old ways to keep warm?**",**What if the only way to stay alive was to use a skill everyone else forgot?**,science fiction,tragedy,coming of age,What is the main problem the characters face in the story?,"The main problem is that the cargo ship has lost power, leaving Endicott and Allison without heat in a snowstorm.",Why can't the characters use the buttons to solve their problem?,"The buttons are useless because the ship is off the powercast, meaning there is no power to operate the machinery.",What does Endicott remember from his childhood that might help them?,"Endicott remembers that in his childhood, people used to gather dry branches and start fires to keep warm, which he tries to do to help them survive the cold.",How does the story illustrate the theme of 'coming of age'?,"The story illustrates 'coming of age' as Allison begins to learn and understand survival skills beyond the reliance on technology, guided by Endicott's memories of the past.",Do you think Endicott's plan to use branches for warmth is a good idea?

047.txt,"There's a small-town library near Charles Neck on Murdock Sound. It's so old and rundown that it still has lots of old books with fancy designs on the cover. After the WFI took over the area, I didn't have much to do, so I would walk to town and grab a few books to read. Those books made me think I was some kind of resistance fighter, but that's silly. I'm too old-fashioned for that. I tried to be more modern, but it made me hard to live with, so I stopped. I knew that eventually the WFI would come after me and stop me from causing trouble.

One cold November morning, while I was having breakfast, I heard the sound of a motor. I went to the end of my wharf and looked up. I figured they wouldn't come by land because the roads were bad, and they wouldn't come by water because it took too much fuel. The WFI was too careful to waste anything. They came by helicopter, which landed next to the wharf. Three men got out. They had WFI badges on their coats and looked cold and bored. The pilot tied up the helicopter, and they came over to me. One of them asked, ""Are you George Arthur Henry?""

I said, ""Just call me George.""

These inspectors were tired and bored from their job. I invited them inside where it was warmer. They followed me into the kitchen, saw my breakfast, and one of them said, ""Eggs."" He was surprised. ""Chickens?"" he asked.

""Where do you think I got the eggs?"" I replied.

Another man quickly took out a notebook and asked what I fed the chickens. I listed seeds, insects, snakes, mussels—since the WFI controlled all the grain. The man seemed excited and rushed out to look at the chickens.

That left two of them with me. The inspector said he was sent to talk to me. He introduced himself as Ranson, a government sociologist. I told him to have a seat and guessed I was in trouble.

I offered the inspector some eggs to take home for his kids, as I probably wouldn't need them anymore. He smiled and carefully took them to the helicopter.

Ranson said, ""That was nice of you, George.""

""Against the law, of course,"" I replied.

Ranson asked if I was against the law. I admitted I was. I didn't like packaged food, and I preferred real food. I had a market for it, even if it was illegal.

Ranson explained that people needed to be fed, and the only way was to combine the world's food resources and process them efficiently. He said I could work for the WFI, but I complained about how everything else was falling apart—roads, gas, buses.

Ranson said it was an emergency that had been building for a long time. I argued that before the WFI closed the Sound, I was independent, but now everything was done by machines, and the jobs were meaningless.

Ranson gave me time to calm down and said that I was a criminal in the eyes of the WFI. I could either join them or be punished. I refused to work for them.

Carter, the ecologist who had been examining the chickens, came back and reported on their condition. Ranson mentioned my illegal activities and asked Carter for help in deciding what to do with me. Carter suggested sending me to man a bird station on Rollins Island. Ranson thought it was a good idea.

I agreed, as it was better than going to prison. Carter explained I would be responsible for processing birds, and I would use my boat to inspect tern colonies.

Later, Carter visited us before we set sail for the island. He told me to read a book he gave me carefully, as it had important information. He hinted that the island wasn't right for some birds and suggested there might be another way to solve the problem.

Rollins Island was large and covered in bird droppings, but it had potential. We were busy processing birds, and eventually, we became sick of the work and the smell.

By the end of the season, most of the birds had left, and we had some time to think. I read the book Carter gave me and started to understand what he meant. I realized we could solve the problem by introducing rats to the island, which would reduce the bird population.

My plan worked; the rats multiplied and drove most of the birds away. We were left with a rat-infested island, but Carter sent supplies and more people to help us turn it into a thriving community.

Carter later explained that the world was falling apart because too much effort went into processing food. Our island was one of several centers meant to preserve knowledge and skills for the future.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the tension between individual independence and the controlling authority of a centralized system, represented by the World Food Initiative (WFI). George, the protagonist, is a symbol of self-sufficiency and resistance against a bureaucratic system that prioritizes efficiency and control over individual freedom and traditional ways of living. This conflict is highlighted through George's illegal activities of producing and consuming ""real food"" in defiance of the WFI's regulations and his reluctance to conform to their demands.

The dilemma intensifies when George is given a choice by Ranson, the government sociologist: join the WFI and work for them or face punishment for his non-compliance. George's refusal to work for the WFI underscores his commitment to his values, but he is forced to compromise by accepting an assignment on Rollins Island rather than going to prison.

The resolution of the conflict emerges as George, through the guidance of Carter, the ecologist, finds a way to subvert the WFI's control by transforming the island into a self-sustaining community. By introducing rats to control the bird population, George inadvertently aligns with Carter's vision of preserving traditional knowledge and skills as a counterbalance to the world's over-reliance on processed food systems. This resolution suggests a synthesis of George's independent spirit with a broader mission to safeguard knowledge for future generations, offering a hopeful path forward amidst societal collapse.",Imagine being forced to choose: join the WFI's strict rules or be punished for eating real food.

She knew what that tone meant. With a sigh, she closed the heavy lead shutters and locked them. It hurt her fingers, but he mustn’t know that. 

""You know those shutters must stay closed! Not for five more years!"" 

""I just wanted to look at the Moon,"" she said. Then it was all gone—the face, the night, the Moon, the magic—and she was back in the dull little room, facing an angry little man. She could hear the eternal thud of the air-conditioning fans and the crackle of the electrostatic dust cleaners again, like a dentist’s drill. 

""Only wanted to look at the Moon!"" he mocked in a high-pitched voice. ""Only wanted to die like a fool and make me ashamed of you!"" Then his voice became serious. ""Here, check yourself."" 

She took the Geiger counter he handed her and waited until it settled into a steady tick, slower than a clock—just cosmic rays, nothing dangerous—and then she checked her body with it. First her head and shoulders, then her arms. There was something graceful about her movements, although her face was gray and tired. 

The ticking didn’t change until she reached her waist. Then it sped up, clicking faster and faster. Her husband made an excited noise, stepped forward, then froze. She looked scared for a moment, then smiled foolishly, dug in her apron pocket, and pulled out a wristwatch. 

He grabbed it from her fingers, saw it had a radium dial, cursed, and almost smashed it on the floor but instead placed it carefully on the table. 

""You fool, you incredible fool,"" he muttered to himself through clenched teeth, his eyes half-closed. 

She shrugged slightly, put the Geiger counter on the table, and stood there slumped. 

He waited until he had calmed down before speaking again. ""Do you still understand the world you're living in?"" 

She nodded slowly, staring into space. Oh, she understood, all right. The world hadn’t understood. The world had kept making hydrogen bombs. The world had put those bombs in cobalt shells, even though it promised it wouldn’t, because cobalt made them worse and didn’t cost more. The world started throwing those bombs, telling itself it hadn’t thrown enough to make the air deadly with radioactive dust. Thrown them and kept on throwing until it almost reached the point where air and ground would be fatal to all life. 

Then, for about a month, the two great enemy groups hesitated. Then each decided it could risk one last big attack without crossing the danger line. They planned to take off the cobalt cases, but someone forgot and there wasn’t time. Besides, they thought the other side got most of the dust. The attacks came within an hour of each other. 

After that, the Fury. The Fury of doomed men wanting to take as many enemies with them as possible. The Fury of suicides who knew they had messed up everything. The Fury of confident men outsmarted by fate and themselves, hoping there would be no history to judge them. More cobalt bombs were dropped during the Fury than in all the years before. 

After the Fury, the Terror. Men and women with death entering their bones through skin and breath, fighting to survive under a dust-filled sky. Cities, countryside, and air poisoned with deadly radiation. 

The only real chance to survive was to stay in a well-sealed place for the five or ten years the radiation would be deadly, with food, water, power, and air-conditioning. 

Such places were made by the smart, taken by the strong, defended by them until there were no more enemies. 

After that, only waiting, enduring. A life like moles, without beauty or tenderness, with fear and guilt as companions. Never to see the Sun, walk among the trees—or even know if there were still trees. 

Oh yes, she understood what the world was like. 

""And you know we got this ground-level apartment because the Committee thought we were responsible, and because I’ve been doing well?"" 

""Yes, Hank."" 

""I thought you wanted privacy. Want to go back to the basement?"" 

God, no! Anything but that crowded, messy place. But was this much better? Being close to the surface meant nothing; it just teased. And privacy made Hank bigger. 

She shook her head and said, ""No, Hank."" 

""Then why aren’t you careful? I’ve told you a million times, Effie, glass is no protection against the dust outside. The lead shutter must stay shut! If you make one mistake and it gets out, the Committee will send us back down without a second thought. They’ll think twice before trusting me with important jobs."" 

""I’m sorry, Hank."" 

""Sorry? What’s the good of sorry? The only thing that counts is not making a mistake! Why do you do such things, Effie? What drives you to it?"" 

She swallowed. ""It’s just so awful being stuck inside,"" she said hesitantly, ""shut away from the sky and the Sun. I just want a little beauty."" 

""And do you think I don’t?"" he demanded. ""Don’t you think I want to get outside and have fun? But I’m not selfish about it. I want my kids to enjoy the Sun, and their kids. Don’t you see that’s the important thing and we have to act like grown-ups and make sacrifices?"" 

""Yes, Hank."" 

He looked at her slumped figure, her tired face. ""You’re a fine one to talk about beauty,"" he said. Then his voice softened. ""You haven’t forgotten, Effie, that until last month the Committee was worried about your sterility? They were about to put my name on the list of men waiting for a free woman? High on the list, too!"" 

She nodded, but not while looking at him. She turned away. She knew well the Committee was right to worry about the birth rate. When people moved to the surface again, each healthy young person would be an asset, not only for survival but in the war against Communism some of the Committee still thought about. 

It was natural they didn’t like sterile women. They wasted their husband’s chances and might have suffered more from radiation. If they had kids later, they might pass on defects and make too many monsters and freaks, hurting the race. 

Of course, she understood. She could hardly remember when she didn’t. Years ago? Centuries? There wasn’t much difference where time was endless. 

His lecture done, her husband smiled and was almost cheerful. 

""Now that you’re going to have a child, that’s all past. Do you know, Effie, I had good news for you? I’m to join the Junior Committee and the announcement’s at the banquet tonight."" He cut off her congratulations. ""So brighten up and put on your best dress. I want the other Juniors to see my attractive wife."" He paused. ""Well, get moving!"" 

She spoke with difficulty, still not looking at him. ""I’m sorry, Hank, but you’ll have to go alone. I’m not well."" 

He straightened up angrily. ""There you go again! First the shutter nonsense, now this! No thought for my reputation. Don’t be ridiculous, Effie. You’re coming!"" 

""Terribly sorry,"" she repeated, ""but I really can’t. I’d just be sick. I wouldn’t make you proud."" 

""Of course you won’t,"" he snapped. ""I have to make excuses for you—why you’re odd, always ailing, saying the wrong thing. But tonight’s important, Effie. If the new member’s wife isn’t there, it’ll cause talk. You know how a hint of sickness starts radiation-disease rumors. You’ve got to come, Effie."" 

She shook her head helplessly. 

""Oh, come on!"" he shouted, coming toward her. ""This is just a silly mood. Once you get going, you’ll snap out of it. There’s nothing really wrong with you."" 

He put a hand on her shoulder to turn her around, and her face suddenly grew so desperate and gray that for a moment he was concerned. 

""Really?"" he asked, almost with concern. 

She nodded miserably. 

""Well, if that’s how it is..."" He checked himself and a sad smile crossed his face. ""So you don’t care about your husband’s success to make an effort?"" 

Again the helpless headshake. ""I just can’t go out tonight, under any circumstances."" And her gaze went to the lead shutters. 

He was about to say something when he saw where she was looking. His eyebrows jumped. He stared at her in disbelief, as if a new idea had popped into his mind. The look of disbelief faded, replaced by a harder expression. But when he spoke, his voice was bright and kind. 

""Well, it can’t be helped, and I wouldn’t want you to go if you couldn’t enjoy it. So go to bed and rest. I’ll freshen up at the men’s dorm. No, really, don’t make any effort. By the way, Jim Barnes can’t come to the banquet either—touch of 'flu, he says."" 

He watched her closely as he mentioned the other man, but she didn’t react. In fact, she hardly seemed to be hearing him. 

""I got sharp with you, I’m afraid,"" he continued. ""I’m sorry. I was excited about my new job and it upset me when you weren’t feeling as good. Selfish of me. Now get to bed and get well. Don’t worry about me. I know you’d come if you could. And I know you’ll be thinking about me. Well, I must go now."" 

He started toward her, then seemed to think better of it. He turned at the doorway. ""You’ll be completely alone for the next four hours."" He waited for her nod, then left. 

She stood still until his footsteps faded. Then she straightened up, picked up the wristwatch, and smashed it on the floor. The crystal shattered, the case flew apart, and something went _zing!_ 

She stood there breathing heavily. Slowly her face lifted into a smile. She looked at the shutters. The smile grew. She felt her hair, wet her fingers and ran them along her hairline. After wiping her hands on her apron, she took it off. She straightened her dress, lifted her head, and stepped toward the window. 

Then her face went miserable again and her steps slowed. 

No, it couldn’t be, and it won’t be, she told herself. It had been just an illusion, a dream she had somehow projected out of her mind. There couldn’t be anything alive outside. There hadn’t been for two years. 

And if there were, it would be horrible. She remembered some of the hairless, witless creatures, with radiation welts, who had come begging during the Terror—and been shot down. How they must have hated the people in refuges! 

But even as she thought these things, her fingers were working the bolts, and she was opening the shutters gently. 

No, there couldn’t be anything outside, she told herself, peering out into the green night. Even her fears had been groundless. 

But the face came floating up toward the window. She stepped back in terror, then checked herself. 

For the face wasn’t horrible at all, only very thin, with full lips and large eyes and a proud nose. No radiation welts or scars marred the skin. It looked just as it had the first time she saw it. 

For a long moment the face stared deep into her mind. Then the lips smiled and a thin hand appeared from the darkness and rapped twice on the glass. 

Her heart pounding, she worked the little crank that opened the window. It came unstuck with a tiny explosion of dust and a _zing_ like that of the watch. A moment later it swung open and a puff of fresh air touched her face and eyes with tears. 

The man outside balanced on the sill, crouching like a faun, head high, one elbow on knee. He was dressed in scarred trousers and an old sweater. 

""Is it tears I get for a welcome?"" he mocked her gently in a musical voice. ""Or are those only to greet God’s own breath, the air?"" 

He swung down inside and now she could see he was tall. Turning, he snapped his fingers and called, ""Come, puss."" 

A black cat with a twisted tail and big ears hopped in view. He lifted it down, gave it a pat. Then, nodding to Effie, he unstrapped a little pack from his back and laid it on the table. 

She couldn’t move. She even found it hard to breathe. 

""The window,"" she finally managed to say. 

He looked at her, caught the direction of her finger. Moving without haste, he went over and closed it. 

""The shutters, too,"" she told him, but he ignored that, looking around. 

""It’s a snug enough place you and your man have,"" he commented. ""Or is it a free-love town, or a harem spot, or just a military post?"" He stopped her before she could answer. ""But let’s not talk about such things now. Soon enough I’ll be scared to death for both of us. Best enjoy the meeting, which is always good for twenty minutes."" He smiled at her. ""Have you food? Good, then bring it."" 

She set cold meat and some precious canned bread before him and had water heating for coffee. Before he fell to, he shredded a chunk of meat and put it on the floor for the cat, which ran up eagerly mewing. Then the man began to eat, chewing slowly and appreciatively. 

From across the table Effie watched him, noticing his every move, his every expression. She made the coffee, but that took only a moment. Finally, she couldn’t hold back. 

""What’s it like up there?"" she asked breathlessly. ""Outside, I mean."" 

He looked at her oddly. Finally, he said, ""Oh, it’s a wonderland, more amazing than you could imagine. A fairyland."" And he went on eating. 

""No, but really,"" she pressed. 

Noting her eagerness, he smiled and his eyes filled with tenderness. ""I mean it,"" he assured her. ""You think the bombs and dust made only death and ugliness. That was true at first. But then, just as doctors said, they changed life in seeds and loins brave enough to stay. Wonders bloomed and walked."" He broke off suddenly. ""Do any of you ever go outside?"" 

""A few men are allowed,"" she told him, ""for short trips in protective suits, to hunt for food and fuel."" 

""Aye, and those blind men would never see anything but what they’re looking for,"" he said bitterly. ""They’d never see the garden where a dozen buds blossom where one did before, and the flowers have petals a yard across, with stingless bees big as sparrows sipping their nectar. Housecats grown huge as leopards (not runts like Joe Louis here) walk through those gardens. But they’re gentle, no more harmful than the rainbow-scaled snakes around their paws, for the dust burned all the murder out of them, as it burned itself out. 

""I’ve even made up a poem about that. It starts, ‘Fire can hurt me, or water, or the weight of Earth. But the dust is my friend.’ Oh, yes, and then the robins like cockatoos and squirrels like ermine! All under a treasure chest of Sun and Moon and stars that the dust’s magic powder changes from ruby to emerald and sapphire and amethyst and back again. Oh, and then the new children—"" 

""You’re telling the truth?"" she interrupted, her eyes full of tears. ""You’re not making it up?"" 

""I am not,"" he assured her. ""And if you could see one of the new children, you’d never doubt me. They have long limbs as brown as this coffee would be with lots of fresh cream, and smiling faces and fine hair. They’re so nimble that I feel like a cripple beside them. And their thoughts dance like flames and make me feel foolish. 

""Of course, they have seven fingers on each hand and eight toes on each foot, but they’re more beautiful for that. They have large pointed ears that the Sun shines through. They play in the garden, all day long, slipping among the leaves and blooms, but they’re so swift you can hardly see them, unless one chooses to stand still and look at you. For that matter, you have to look hard for all these things I’m telling you."" 

""But it is true?"" she pleaded. 

""Every word of it,"" he said, looking into her eyes. He put down his knife and fork. ""What’s your name?"" he asked softly. ""Mine’s Patrick."" 

""Effie,"" she told him. 

He shook his head. ""That can’t be,"" he said. Then his face brightened. ""Euphemia,"" he exclaimed. ""That’s what Effie is short for. Your name is Euphemia."" As he said that, looking at her, she suddenly felt beautiful. He got up and came around the table and stretched out his hand. 

""Euphemia—"" he began. 

""Yes?"" she answered, looking up sideways, very flushed. 

""Don’t either of you move,"" Hank said. 

The voice was flat and nasal because Hank was wearing a nose respirator just long enough to suggest an elephant’s trunk. In his right hand was a large blue-black automatic pistol. 

They turned their faces to him. Patrick’s was alert, shifty. But Effie’s was still smiling tenderly, as if Hank could not break the spell of the magic garden and should be pitied for not knowing about it. 

""You little—"" Hank began with an angry fury, calling her names. ""And not with a man of the community, but a pariah! A pariah!"" 

""I hardly know what you’re thinking, man, but you’re quite wrong,"" Patrick said. ""I just happened to be coming by hungry tonight, a lonely tramp, and knocked at the window. Your wife was a bit foolish and let kindness get the better of prudence—"" 

""Don’t think you’ve fooled me, Effie,"" Hank went on, ignoring the other man. ""Don’t think I don’t know why you’re suddenly going to have a child after four long years."" 

At that moment the cat came up to his feet. Patrick watched him closely, shifting his weight forward a little, but Hank only kicked the animal aside, keeping his eyes on them. 

""Even that business of carrying the wristwatch in your pocket instead of on your arm,"" he went on. ""A neat bit of camouflage, Effie. Very neat. And telling me it was my child when all the while you’ve been seeing him for months!"" 

""Man, you’re mad; I’ve not touched her!"" Patrick denied hotly, and risked a step forward, stopping when the gun swung his way. 

""Pretending you were going to give me a healthy child,"" Hank raved on, ""when all the while you knew it would be—either in body or germ plasm—a thing like that!"" 

He waved his gun at the malformed cat, which had leaped to the top of the table and was eating Patrick’s food, though its watchful green eyes were fixed on Hank. 

""I should shoot him down!"" Hank yelled, between sobbing, chest-racking breaths through the mask. ""I should kill him this instant for the contaminated pariah he is!"" 

All this while Effie had not ceased to smile compassionately. Now she stood up without haste and went to Patrick’s side. Disregarding his glance, she put her arm around him and faced her husband. 

""Then you’d be killing the bringer of the best news we’ve ever had,"" she said, and her voice was like a flood of some warm sweet liquor in that musty, hate-charged room. ""Oh, Hank, forget your silly, wrong jealousy and listen to me. Patrick here has something wonderful to tell us."" 

Hank stared at her. For once he screamed no reply. It was obvious that he was seeing for the first time how beautiful she had become, and that the realization jolted him terribly. 

""What do you mean?"" he finally asked unevenly, almost fearfully. 

""I mean that we no longer need to fear the dust,"" she said, and now her smile was radiant. ""It never really did hurt people the way the doctors said it would. Remember how it was with me, Hank, the exposure I had and recovered from, although the doctors said I wouldn’t at first—and without even losing my hair? Hank, those who were brave enough to stay outside, and who weren’t killed by terror and suggestion and panic—they adapted to the dust. They changed, but they changed for the better. Everything—"" 

""Effie, he told you lies!"" Hank interrupted, but still in that same agitated, broken voice, cowed by her beauty. 

""Everything that grew or moved was purified,"" she went on ringingly. ""You men going outside have never seen it, because you’ve never had eyes for it. You’ve been blinded to beauty, to life itself. And now all the power in the dust has gone and faded, anyway, burned itself out. That’s true, isn’t it?"" 

She smiled at Patrick for confirmation. His face was strangely veiled, as if he were calculating changes. He might have nodded; Effie assumed he did, for she turned back to her husband. 

""You see, Hank? We can all go out now. We need never fear the dust again. Patrick is living proof,"" she continued triumphantly, standing straighter, holding him tighter. ""Look at him. Not a scar or a sign, and he’s been in the dust for years. How could he be this way, if the dust hurt the brave? Oh, believe me, Hank! Believe what you see. Test it if you want. Test Patrick here."" 

""Effie, you’re all mixed up. You don’t know—"" Hank faltered, but without conviction. 

""Just test him,"" Effie repeated with confidence, ignoring Patrick’s warning nudge. 

""All right,"" Hank mumbled. He looked at the stranger dully. ""Can you count?"" he asked. 

Patrick’s face was an enigma. Then he spoke, and his voice was alert, light, bright. 

""Can I count? Do you take me for a simpleton? Of course I can count!"" 

""Then count yourself,"" Hank said, barely pointing at the table. 

""Count myself, should I?"" the other retorted with a quick laugh. ""Is this kindergarten? But if you want me to, I’m willing."" His voice was quick. ""I’ve two arms, and two legs, that’s four. And ten fingers and ten toes—you’ll take my word?—that’s twenty-four. A head, twenty-five. And two eyes and a nose and a mouth—"" 

""With this, I mean,"" Hank said, handing the Geiger counter across the table. 

But while it was still an arm’s length from Patrick, the clicks began to mount furiously, until they were like the chatter of a machine gun. Abruptly the clicks slowed, but that was only the counter shifting to a new circuit, where each click stood for hundreds of the old ones. 

With those rattling volleys, fear filled the room, smashing all the barriers of words Effie had raised against it. For no dreams can stand against the Geiger counter, the Twentieth Century’s mouthpiece of truth. It was as if the dust and all the terrors of the dust had taken one dread shape that said, ""Those were illusions, whistles in the dark. This is reality, the pitiless reality of the Burrowing Years."" 

Hank scuttled back to the wall. Through chattering teeth he babbled, ""... enough radioactives ... kill a thousand men ... freak ... a freak ..."" In his agitation he forgot to inhale through the respirator. 

Even Effie—taken off guard, all the fears drilled into her twanging—shrank from the shape beside her, held herself to it only by desperation. 

Patrick did it for her. He disengaged her arm and stepped briskly away. Then he whirled on them, smiling sardonically, and started to speak, but instead looked with distaste at the chattering Geiger counter he held between fingers and thumb. 

""Have we listened to this racket long enough?"" he asked. 

Without waiting for an answer, he put down the instrument on the table. The cat hurried over to it and the clicks began to mount. Effie lunged for it, switched it off, darted back. 

""That's right,"" Patrick said with a chilling smile. ""You do well to cringe, for I'm death itself. Even in death I could kill you, like a snake."" And with that his voice took on the tones of a circus barker. ""Yes, I'm a freak. That's what one doctor who dared talk with me for a minute told me before he kicked me out. He couldn't tell me why, but somehow the dust doesn't kill me. Because I'm a freak, you see, just like the men who ate nails and walked on fire and ate arsenic and stuck themselves through with pins. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen—only not too close!—and examine the man the dust can't harm. Rappaccini's child, brought up to date; his embrace, death! 

""And now,"" he said, breathing heavily, ""I'll get out and leave you in your damned lead cave."" 

He started toward the window. Hank's gun followed him shakingly. 

""Wait!"" Effie called in an agonized voice. He obeyed. She continued, ""When we were together earlier, you didn't act as if ..."" 

""When we were together earlier, I wanted what I wanted,"" he snarled at her. ""You don't suppose I'm a saint, do you?"" 

""And all the beautiful things you told me?"" 

""That,"" he said cruelly, ""is just a line I've found that women fall for. They're all so bored and so starved for beauty—as _they_ generally put it."" 

""Even the garden?"" Her question was barely audible through the sobs that threatened to suffocate her. 

He looked at her and perhaps his expression softened a bit. 

""What's outside,"" he said flatly, ""is just a little worse than either of you can imagine."" He tapped his temple. ""The garden's all here."" 

""You've killed it,"" she wept. ""You've killed it in me. You've both killed everything that's beautiful. But you're worse,"" she screamed at Patrick, ""because he only killed beauty once, but you brought it to life just so you could kill it again. Oh, I can't stand it! I won't stand it!"" And she began to scream. 

Patrick started toward her, but she broke off and whirled away from him to the window, her eyes wild. 

""You've been lying to us,"" she cried. ""The garden's there. I know it is. But you don't want to share it with anyone."" 

""No, no, Euphemia,"" Patrick protested anxiously. ""It's hell out there, believe me. I wouldn't lie to you about it."" 

""Wouldn't lie to me!"" she mocked. ""Are you afraid, too?"" 

With a sudden pull, she jerked open the window and stood before the blank green-tinged darkness that seemed to press into the room like a menacing curtain. 

At that Hank cried out a shocked, pleading, ""Effie!"" 

She ignored him. ""I can't be cooped up here any longer,"" she said. ""And I won't, now that I know. I'm going to the garden."" 

Both men sprang at her, but they were too late. She leaped to the sill, and by the time they had flung themselves against it, her footsteps were already hurrying off into the darkness. 

""Effie, come back! Come back!"" Hank shouted after her desperately, no longer thinking to cringe from the man beside him, or how the gun was pointed. ""I love you, Effie. Come back!"" 

Patrick added his voice. ""Come back, Euphemia. You'll be safe if you come back right away. Come back to your home."" 

No answer to that at all. 

They both strained their eyes through the greenish murk. They could barely make out a shadowy figure down the near-black canyon of the street, where the greenish moonlight hardly reached. It seemed to them that the figure was scooping something up from the pavement and letting it sift down along its arms and over its bosom. 

""Go out and get her, man,"" Patrick urged the other. ""For if I go out for her, I warn you I won't bring her back. She said something about standing the dust better than most, and that's enough for me."" 

But Hank, chained by his learned habits and something else, could not move. 

And then a ghostly voice came whispering down the street, chanting, ""Fire can hurt me, or water, or the weight of Earth. But the dust is my friend."" 

Patrick spared the other man one more look. Then, without a word, he vaulted up and ran off. 

Hank stood there. After perhaps a half minute he remembered to close his mouth when he inhaled. Finally he was sure the street was empty. As he started to close the window, there was a little _mew_. 

He picked up the cat and gently put it outside. Then he did close the window, and the shutters, and bolted them, and took up the Geiger counter, and mechanically began to count himself. 

--FRITZ LEIBER

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MOON IS GREEN ***",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""The Moon is Green"" by Fritz Leiber is a clash between the oppressive, fear-driven reality of the post-apocalyptic world and the yearning for beauty, freedom, and truth. This internal and external conflict manifests through the protagonist, Effie, who is caught between the grim, controlled life inside the lead-shuttered apartment and the tantalizing possibility of a beautiful world outside, as suggested by Patrick, a stranger who disrupts her life.

The dilemma is further complicated by her relationship with her husband, Hank, who represents the oppressive societal norms and survival instincts that prioritize safety over personal desires. Effie's longing for something beyond the bleak existence is at odds with Hank's adherence to the rules meant to keep them safe from the radioactive world outside.

Effie's struggle is both internal—her desire for beauty and meaning in a confined existence—and external, illustrated by her interactions with Hank and Patrick. The story explores themes of illusion versus reality, safety versus freedom, and truth versus deception, culminating in Effie's decision to escape the confines of her sheltered life, despite the risks, in pursuit of a potentially illusory garden of beauty and freedom.","What if the person you trust most says the world outside will kill you, but you feel they're wrong?","If you were told the air outside was poison, would you open the shutters just to breathe it?",Could you leave safety behind if someone promised you a world more beautiful than dreams?,science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,What does Effie see when she looks out the window?,"Effie sees a face that appears beautiful and tempting, moving away from the window into the dark.",Why does Hank want Effie to keep the shutters closed?,"Hank wants Effie to keep the shutters closed to protect them from the radioactive dust outside, which is deadly.",What might happen if Effie continues to open the shutters?,"If Effie continues to open the shutters, she risks exposing herself and Hank to the radioactive dust, which could lead to their death or force them to move back to the basement.",How does the story illustrate the theme of 'good vs. evil'?,"The story illustrates 'good vs. evil' through the conflict between the desire for beauty and freedom (good) and the oppressive, fear-driven survival tactics (evil) that Hank represents.

050.txt,"The lazy wub might have said: Many people talk like they're wise but live foolishly.

The crew was almost done loading the spaceship. Outside, a man called the Optus stood with his arms crossed, looking unhappy. Captain Franco walked down the ramp, smiling.

""What's wrong?"" he asked. ""You're getting paid for this.""

The Optus didn't say anything. He turned away, gathering his robes. Captain Franco stepped on the edge of his robe.

""Wait a minute. Don't leave yet. I'm not done.""

""Oh?"" The Optus turned back with dignity. ""I'm going back to the village."" He looked at the animals and birds being taken onto the spaceship. ""I need to organize new hunts.""

Franco lit a cigarette. ""Why not? You can go hunt for more. But when we run out halfway between Mars and Earth—""

The Optus left without a word. Franco joined the first mate at the bottom of the ramp.

""How's it going?"" he asked, checking his watch. ""We got a good deal here.""

The mate looked at him unhappily. ""How do you explain that?""

""What's wrong with you? We need this more than they do.""

""I'll talk to you later, Captain."" The mate went up the ramp, past the long-legged Martian go-birds, into the ship. Franco watched him go. He was about to follow when he saw it.

""My God!"" He stopped, staring with his hands on his hips. Peterson was walking up, his face red, leading it by a string.

""I'm sorry, Captain,"" he said, pulling the string. Franco walked over to him.

""What is it?""

The wub stood there, its big body slowly settling. It sat down, half-closing its eyes. A few flies buzzed around it, and it flicked its tail.

It sat quietly.

""It's a wub,"" Peterson said. ""I got it from a native for fifty cents. He said it was very special. Very respected.""

""This?"" Franco poked the wub's side. ""It's a pig! A huge, dirty pig!""

""Yes sir, it's a pig. The natives call it a wub.""

""A huge pig. It must weigh four hundred pounds."" Franco grabbed a tuft of its rough hair. The wub gasped, its eyes opening, small and wet. Its big mouth twitched.

A tear rolled down the wub's cheek and hit the floor.

""Maybe it's good to eat,"" Peterson said nervously.

""We'll soon find out,"" Franco said.

The wub survived the take-off, sleeping in the hold of the ship. Once they were in space and everything was running smoothly, Captain Franco asked his men to bring the wub upstairs to see what kind of creature it was.

The wub grunted and wheezed, squeezing through the passageway.

""Come on,"" Jones said, pulling the rope. The wub twisted, rubbing its skin on the shiny walls. It tumbled into the room, falling in a heap. The men jumped up.

""Good Lord,"" French said. ""What is it?""

""Peterson says it's a wub,"" Jones said. ""It's his."" He kicked the wub. The wub stood up unsteadily, panting.

""What's wrong with it?"" French came over. ""Is it sick?""

They watched. The wub rolled its eyes sadly. It looked around at the men.

""I think it's thirsty,"" Peterson said. He went to get some water. French shook his head.

""No wonder we had trouble taking off. I had to redo all my weight calculations.""

Peterson came back with the water. The wub drank gratefully, splashing the men.

Captain Franco appeared at the door.

""Let's see it."" He walked over, squinting. ""You got this for fifty cents?""

""Yes, sir,"" Peterson said. ""It eats almost anything. I fed it grain, and it liked that. Also potatoes, mash, table scraps, and milk. It really enjoys eating. After eating, it sleeps.""

""I see,"" Captain Franco said. ""Now, about its taste. That's the real question. I doubt we need to fatten it up more. It looks fat enough already. Where's the cook? I want to find out—""

The wub stopped drinking and looked up at the Captain.

""Really, Captain,"" the wub said. ""I suggest we talk about other things.""

The room was silent.

""What was that?"" Franco said. ""Just now.""

""The wub, sir,"" Peterson said. ""It spoke.""

They all looked at the wub.

""What did it say? What did it say?""

""It suggested we talk about other things.""

Franco walked toward the wub, looking at it from every angle. Then he came back to the men.

""I wonder if there's a native inside it,"" he said thoughtfully. ""Maybe we should open it up and see.""

""Oh, goodness!"" the wub cried. ""Is that all you think about, killing and cutting?""

Franco clenched his fists. ""Come out of there! Whoever you are, come out!""

Nothing moved. The men stood together, confused, staring at the wub. The wub swished its tail and burped suddenly.

""I beg your pardon,"" the wub said.

""I don't think there's anyone in there,"" Jones said quietly. They all looked at each other.

The cook came in.

""You wanted me, Captain?"" he said. ""What's this thing?""

""This is a wub,"" Franco said. ""It's for eating. Will you measure it and figure out—""

""I think we should talk,"" the wub said. ""I'd like to discuss this with you, Captain, if I might. I can see that we don't agree on some important things.""

The Captain took a long time to answer. The wub waited patiently, licking the water from its lips.

""Come into my office,"" the Captain said finally. He turned and walked out of the room. The wub got up and followed him. The men watched it leave. They heard it climbing the stairs.

""I wonder what will happen,"" the cook said. ""Well, I'll be in the kitchen. Let me know when you hear.""

""Sure,"" Jones said. ""Sure.""

The wub settled down in the corner with a sigh. ""You must forgive me,"" it said. ""I'm afraid I like to relax. When you're as big as I am—""

The Captain nodded impatiently. He sat at his desk and folded his hands.

""All right,"" he said. ""Let's get started. You're a wub? Is that right?""

The wub shrugged. ""I suppose so. That's what the natives call us. We have our own name.""

""And you speak English? You've met Earth people before?""

""No.""

""Then how do you do it?""

""Speak English? Am I speaking English? I'm not really aware of speaking anything. I looked at your mind—""

""My mind?""

""I studied what you know, especially the words and meanings—""

""I see,"" the Captain said. ""Telepathy. Of course.""

""We are a very old race,"" the wub said. ""Very old and very slow. It's hard for us to move around. You can see that anything so slow would be easy prey for faster creatures. We couldn't rely on physical defenses. How could we win? Too heavy to run, too soft to fight, too kind to hunt—""

""How do you live?""

""Plants. Vegetables. We can eat almost anything. We're very open-minded. We live and let live. That's how we've survived.""

The wub looked at the Captain.

""And that's why I was so against the idea of eating me. I saw the image in your mind—most of me in the freezer, some of me in the pot, a bit for your cat—""

""So you read minds?"" the Captain said. ""Interesting. What else can you do?""

""A few other things,"" the wub said, looking around the room. ""A nice place you have here, Captain. You keep it tidy. I respect life forms that are tidy. Some Martian birds are very tidy. They clean their nests—""

""Indeed."" The Captain nodded. ""But back to the issue—""

""Yes. You talked about eating me. The taste, I've heard, is good. A bit fatty, but tender. But how can any real relationship be made between your people and mine if you have such cruel ideas? Eat me? You should discuss things with me, like philosophy, the arts—""

The Captain stood up. ""Philosophy. It might interest you to know that we'll struggle to find food for the next month. An unfortunate spoilage—""

""I know."" The wub nodded. ""But wouldn't it be more fair to draw straws or something like that? Democracy is meant to protect the minority from such things. If we each cast one vote—""

The Captain walked to the door.

""Nuts to you,"" he said. He opened the door. He opened his mouth.

He stood frozen, his mouth wide open, his eyes staring, his hand still on the knob.

The wub watched him. Then it walked out of the room, thinking deeply.

The room was quiet.

""So you see,"" the wub said, ""we have a shared myth. Your mind has many familiar myth symbols. Ishtar, Odysseus—""

Peterson sat silently, staring at the floor. He shifted in his chair.

""Go on,"" he said. ""Please go on.""

""I find in your Odysseus a figure common in the myths of many self-aware races. As I see it, Odysseus travels alone, aware of himself. This is the idea of separation from family and home. The process of becoming an individual.""

""But Odysseus goes home."" Peterson looked out the window at the endless stars in the dark universe. ""He finally goes home.""

""As all creatures must. The time of separation is temporary, a short journey. It begins, it ends. The traveler returns to family and home...""

The door opened. The wub stopped, turning its large head.

Captain Franco came in with the men behind him. They paused at the door.

""Are you okay?"" French asked.

""Do you mean me?"" Peterson said, surprised. ""Why me?""

Franco lowered his gun. ""Come over here,"" he said to Peterson. ""Get up and come here.""

There was silence.

""Go ahead,"" the wub said. ""It doesn't matter.""

Peterson stood up. ""Why?""

""It's an order.""

Peterson walked to the door. French grabbed his arm.

""What's going on?"" Peterson pulled away. ""What's wrong with you?""

Captain Franco moved toward the wub. The wub looked up from where it lay against the wall.

""It's interesting,"" the wub said, ""that you're so focused on eating me. I wonder why.""

""Get up,"" Franco said.

""If you wish."" The wub rose, grunting. ""Be patient. It's hard for me."" It stood, breathing heavily, its tongue hanging out.

""Shoot it now,"" French said.

""For God's sake!"" Peterson exclaimed. Jones turned to him quickly, scared.

""You didn't see him—like a statue, standing there, mouth open. If we hadn't come, he'd still be there.""

""Who? The Captain?"" Peterson looked around. ""But he's okay now.""

They looked at the wub, standing in the room, its big chest moving up and down.

""Come on,"" Franco said. ""Move aside.""

The men stepped back toward the door.

""You're quite scared, aren't you?"" the wub said. ""Have I done anything to you? I'm against hurting anyone. All I've done is try to protect myself. Can you expect me to rush to my death? I'm a sensible being like you. I was curious about your ship, wanted to learn about you. I suggested to the native—""

The gun jerked.

""See,"" Franco said. ""I thought so.""

The wub settled down, panting. It put its paw out, pulling its tail around it.

""It's very warm,"" the wub said. ""I understand we're close to the jets. Atomic power. You've done many amazing things with it—technically. But maybe your scientific leaders aren't good with moral, ethical—""

Franco turned to the men, who stood behind him, wide-eyed and silent.

""I'll do it. You can watch.""

French nodded. ""Try to hit the brain. It's no good for eating. Don't hit the chest. If the ribs break, we'll have to pick bones out.""

""Listen,"" Peterson said, licking his lips. ""Has it done anything wrong? What harm has it done? And anyway, it's mine. You have no right to shoot it. It doesn't belong to you.""

Franco raised his gun.

""I'm leaving,"" Jones said, looking sick. ""I don't want to see it.""

""Me, too,"" French said. The men left, murmuring. Peterson lingered at the door.

""It was talking to me about myths,"" he said. ""It wouldn't hurt anyone.""

He went outside.

Franco walked toward the wub. The wub looked up slowly. It swallowed.

""A very foolish thing,"" it said. ""I'm sorry you want to do this. There was a story your Savior told—""

It stopped, staring at the gun.

""Can you look me in the eye and do it?"" the wub said. ""Can you do that?""

The Captain looked down. ""I can look you in the eye,"" he said. ""Back on the farm we had hogs, dirty hogs. I can do it.""

Looking down at the wub's gleaming, moist eyes, he pulled the trigger.

The taste was excellent.

They sat quietly around the table, some barely eating. The only one enjoying himself was Captain Franco.

""More?"" he asked, looking around. ""More? And some wine, maybe.""

""Not me,"" French said. ""I think I'll go back to the chart room.""

""Me, too."" Jones stood up, pushing his chair back. ""I'll see you later.""

The Captain watched them leave. Some others excused themselves.

""What do you think is the matter?"" the Captain said. He turned to Peterson. Peterson sat staring at his plate, at the potatoes, the green peas, and the thick slice of tender, warm meat.

He opened his mouth. No sound came.

The Captain put his hand on Peterson's shoulder.

""It's only organic matter now,"" he said. ""The life essence is gone."" He ate, dipping bread in the gravy. ""I, myself, love to eat. It's one of the greatest things a living creature can enjoy. Eating, resting, thinking, talking about things.""

Peterson nodded. Two more men got up and left. The Captain drank some water and sighed.

""Well,"" he said. ""I must say this was a very enjoyable meal. All the reports I heard were true—the taste of wub. Very fine. But I was stopped from enjoying this before.""

He wiped his lips with a napkin and leaned back in his chair. Peterson stared sadly at the table.

The Captain watched him closely. He leaned over.

""Come on,"" he said. ""Cheer up! Let's talk.""

He smiled.

""As I was saying before I was interrupted, the role of Odysseus in the myths—""

Peterson looked up, surprised.

""To continue,"" the Captain said. ""Odysseus, as I understand him—""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""The Lazy Wub"" revolves around the moral and ethical dilemma of whether or not to eat the wub, a creature that displays intelligence and the ability to communicate. This story explores themes of empathy, understanding, and the often-blind pursuit of survival instincts over more humane considerations.

Captain Franco and his crew face a situation where their practical need for food conflicts with the ethical implications of consuming a sentient being. The wub, through its conversations and expressions, challenges the crew's perception of it as merely food, suggesting that it should be valued for its intellectual and philosophical contributions rather than its potential as a meal.

The dilemma is further complicated by the wub's ability to communicate telepathically, which forces the crew to confront the idea of consuming a creature capable of thought and reasoning. The wub's discussions about mythology and philosophy serve as a metaphor for the broader human tendency to overlook wisdom and understanding in favor of more immediate, pragmatic concerns.

Ultimately, the resolution of the conflict highlights the tension between human instincts and moral considerations, leaving readers to reflect on the choices made by Captain Franco and his crew and the broader implications of these decisions.",Can you justify eating something that begs for its life?,"POV: The creature on our spaceship just said, ""Please don't eat me.""",Is survival worth sacrificing your morals when dinner talks back?,science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,What is the creature called that Peterson brings onto the spaceship?,The creature is called a wub.,Why does the wub not want to be eaten?,The wub does not want to be eaten because it is a sentient being that values life and prefers to discuss philosophy and arts rather than be killed.,What might happen if the crew runs out of food on their journey?,"If the crew runs out of food, they might face starvation or have to make difficult decisions about rationing or finding alternative food sources.",How does the wub's ability to speak and reason affect the crew's perception of it?,"The wub's ability to speak and reason challenges the crew's perception of it as merely an animal to be eaten, causing some of them to question the morality of killing and eating a sentient being.",Do you think Captain Franco made the right decision in the end?

054.txt,"Rufus Sollenar was a man who sold dreams, offering other people worlds beyond what they could imagine. Yet his biggest challenge was that he couldn't see what he needed to learn about himself.

The phone on Rufus Sollenar's desk rang softly, like the gentle cooing of a mourning dove. Sollenar was standing fifty steps away, his head held high like a lion's, hands in his hip pockets, looking through the crystal wall that showed him the dark world outside over Manhattan Island. The window was so high up that some of what he saw was blurred by the clouds hanging low over the rivers. Above him were stars; below him, the city was lit up and bright. A shooting star—an interplanetary rocket—rushed down toward Long Island like a scratch across a black door.

Sollenar was taking it all in, but he was really watching the whole scene, not just one part of it. His eyes were shining.

When he heard the phone, he raised his left hand to his mouth. ""Yes?"" His hand glittered with rings that looked like they were trying to hold his fingers together, kind of like the way old ships used to be reinforced.

His receptionist's voice came through the air near his ear, though she was sitting somewhere else in the building. She said, ""Mr. Ermine says he has an appointment.""

""No,"" Sollenar said, dropping his hand and turning back to the view. When he was twenty years younger, working at the small optical factory his family had run for three generations, he had always wanted to be able to stand in a place like this and feel what he imagined men in such positions felt. But now he felt unimaginable.

It was one thing to be here. It was another to almost lose the chance and then get it back at the last minute. Now he knew he could be here today, and tomorrow, and the day after. He had won. His risky move had given him EmpaVid—and EmpaVid would give him everything.

The city wasn't just a prize in front of his eyes. It was a system he had proved he could control. He and the city were one. It lifted him up and kept him afloat; it supported him, here in the air, with stars above and the mist thick with light below.

The phone rang again: ""Mr. Ermine states he has a firm appointment.""

""I've never heard of him."" Sollenar dropped his hand from his lips again. He liked such toys. He raised his right hand, covered in thin midnight-blue silk with silver threads running toward the fingertips. He touched two fingers together: music began to play around him. He pressed another combination of fingers and heard a soft, feminine laugh from the terrace on the other side of the room, where a door had opened. He moved toward it. A layer of see-through curtains blew gently in the breeze from the terrace. Through it, he could see a small table with a candle lit; a chilled bottle of wine in a stand next to it; two delicate chairs; and Bess Allardyce, slender and graceful, waiting in one of them—all these through the misty curtain, like the start or the end of a dream.

""Mr. Ermine reminds you the appointment was made for him at the Annual Business Dinner of the International Association of Broadcasters, in 1998.""

Sollenar stopped and frowned at his left hand. ""Is Mr. Ermine with the IAB's Special Public Relations Office?""

""Yes,"" the voice said after a pause.

Sollenar's fingers formed a cone. The door closed. The girl was gone. The music stopped. ""All right. Tell Mr. Ermine to come up."" Sollenar went to sit at his desk.

The office door chimed. Sollenar bent a finger, and the door opened. With another gesture, he turned on the overhead lights near the door and sat in the shadow as Mr. Ermine came in.

Ermine was dressed in clothes the color of rust. He was thin, and his hands were empty. His face was round and soft, with long dark sideburns. His scalp was bald. He stood just inside Sollenar's office and said, ""I would like some light to see you by, Mr. Sollenar.""

Sollenar bent his little finger.

The lights softly brightened the whole office. The crystal wall became a mirror, with only the brightest city lights shining through. ""I only wanted to see you first,"" said Sollenar; ""I thought perhaps we'd met before.""

""No,"" Ermine said, walking across the office. ""It's not likely you've ever seen me."" He took a card from his pocket and showed Sollenar his identification. ""I'm not a very forward person.""

""Please sit down,"" Sollenar said. ""What can I do for you?""

""At the moment, Mr. Sollenar, I'm doing something for you.""

Sollenar sat back in his chair. ""Are you? Are you, now?"" He frowned at Ermine. ""When I became a party to the By-Laws passed at the '98 Dinner, I thought a Special Public Relations Office would be a valuable asset to the organization. Consequently, I voted for it, and for the powers it was given. But I never thought I'd have to deal with it personally. I barely remembered you people had carte blanche with any IAB member.""

""Well, of course, it's been a while since '98,"" Ermine said. ""I imagine some legends have grown up around us. Industry gossip—that sort of thing.""

""Yes.""

""But we don't restrict ourselves to an enforcement function, Mr. Sollenar. You haven't broken any By-Laws, to our knowledge.""

""Nor mine. But nobody feels one hundred percent secure. Not under these circumstances."" Nor did Sollenar yet relax his face into its magnificent smile. ""I'm sure you've found that out.""

""I have a somewhat less ambitious older brother who's with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When I started my own career, he told me I could expect everyone in the world to react like a criminal, yes,"" Ermine said, paying no attention to Sollenar's involuntary blink. ""It's one of the complicating factors in a profession like my brother's, or mine. But I'm here to advise you, Mr. Sollenar. Only that.""

""In what matter, Mr. Ermine?""

""Well, your corporation recently came into control of the patents for a new video system. I understand that this in effect makes your corporation the licensor for an extremely valuable sales and entertainment medium. Fantastically valuable.""

""EmpaVid,"" Sollenar agreed. ""Various subliminal stimuli are broadcast with and keyed to the overt subject matter. The home receiving unit contains feedback sensors which determine the viewer's reaction to these stimuli and intensify some while playing down others to create complete emotional rapport between the viewer and the subject matter. EmpaVid, in other words, is a system for orchestrating the viewer's emotions. The home unit is self-contained, semi-portable, and not significantly bulkier than the standard TV receiver. EmpaVid is compatible with standard TV receivers—except, of course, that the subject matter seems thin and vaguely unsatisfactory on a standard receiver. So the consumer shortly purchases an EV unit."" It pleased Sollenar to spell out the nature of his prize.

""At a very reasonable price. Quite so, Mr. Sollenar. But you had several difficulties in finding potential licensees for this system among the networks.""

Sollenar's lips pinched out.

Mr. Ermine raised one finger. ""First, there was the matter of acquiring the patents from the original inventor, who was also approached by Cortwright Burr.""

""Yes, he was,"" Sollenar said in a completely new voice.

""Competition between Mr. Burr and yourself is long-standing and intense.""

""Quite intense,"" Sollenar said, looking directly ahead of him at the one blank wall of the office. Burr's offices were several blocks downtown, in that direction.

""Well, I have no wish to enlarge on that point, Mr. Burr being an IAB member in standing as good as yours, Mr. Sollenar. There was, in any case, a further difficulty in licensing EV, due to the very heavy cost involved in equipping broadcasting stations and network relay equipment for this sort of transmission.""

""Yes, there was.""

""Ultimately, however, you succeeded. You pointed out, quite rightly, that if just one station made the change, and if just a few EV receivers were put into public places within the area served by that station, normal TV outlets could not possibly compete for advertising revenue.""

""Yes.""

""And so your last difficulties were resolved a few days ago, when your EmpaVid Unlimited—pardon me; when EmpaVid, a subsidiary of the Sollenar Corporation—became a major stockholder in the Transworld TV Network.""

""I don't understand, Mr. Ermine,"" Sollenar said. ""Why are you recounting this? Are you trying to demonstrate the power of your knowledge? All these transactions are already matters of record in the IAB confidential files, in accordance with the By-Laws.""

Ermine held up another finger. ""You're forgetting I'm only here to advise you. I have two things to say. They are:

""These transactions are on file with the IAB because they involve a great number of IAB members and an increasingly large amount of capital. Also, Transworld's exclusivity, under the IAB By-Laws, will hold good only until thirty-three percent market saturation has been reached. If EV is as good as it looks, that will be quite soon. After that, under the By-Laws, Transworld will be restrained from making effective defenses against patent infringement by competitors. Then all of the IAB's membership and much of their capital will be involved with EV. Much of that capital is already in anticipatory motion. So a highly complex structure now ultimately depends on the integrity of the Sollenar Corporation. If Sollenar stock falls in value, not just you but many IAB members will be greatly embarrassed. Which is another way of saying EV must succeed.""

""I know all that! What of it? There's no risk. I've had every related patent on Earth checked. There will be no catastrophic obsolescence of the EV system.""

Ermine said: ""There are engineers on Mars. Martian engineers. They're a dying race, but no one knows what they can still do.""

Sollenar raised his massive head.

Ermine said: ""Late this evening, my office learned that Cortwright Burr has been in close consultation with the Martians for several weeks. They have made some sort of machine for him. He was on the flight that landed at the Facility a few moments ago.""

Sollenar's fists clenched. The lights crashed off and on, and the room wailed. From the terrace came a startled cry, and a sound of smashed glass.

Mr. Ermine nodded, excused himself, and left.

A few moments later, Mr. Ermine stepped out at the pedestrian level of the Sollenar Building. He strolled through the landscaped garden and across the bubbling brook toward the central walkway down the Avenue. He paused at a hedge to pluck a blossom and inhale its scent. He walked away, holding it in his bare fingers.

---

Drifting slowly on the thread of his spinneret, Rufus Sollenar came gliding down the wind above Cortwright Burr's building.

The building, like a spider, touched the ground at only the points of its legs. It held its wide, low bulk spread like a parasol over several downtown blocks. Sollenar, steering the helium-filled plastic drifter far above him, guided himself with jets of compressed gas from plastic bottles in the drifter's structure.

Only Sollenar himself, in all this system, was not effectively transparent to the municipal anti-plane radar. And he himself was wrapped in long, fluttering streamers of dull black, metallic sheeting. To the eye, he was amorphous and non-reflective. To electronic sensors, he was a drift of static much like a sheet of foil picked by the wind from some careless trash heap. To all of the senses of all interested parties, he was hardly there at all—and, thus, in an excellent position for murder.

He fluttered against Burr's window. There was the man, crouched over his desk. What was that in his hands—a pomander?

Sollenar clipped his harness to the edges of the cornice. Swayed out against it, his sponge-soled boots pressed to the glass, he touched his left hand to the window and described a circle. He pushed; there was a thud on the carpet in Burr's office, and now there was no barrier to Sollenar. Doubling his knees against his chest, he catapulted forward, the riot pistol in his right hand. He stumbled and fell to his knees, but the gun was up.

Burr jolted up behind his desk. The little sphere of orange-gold metal, streaked with darker bronze, its surface bumpy with encrustations, was still in his hands. ""Him!"" Burr cried out as Sollenar fired.

Gasping, Sollenar watched the charge strike Burr. It threw his torso backward faster than his limbs and head could follow without dangling. The pistol was nearly silent. Burr crashed backward to end, pinned, against the wall.

Pale and sick, Sollenar moved to take the golden ball. He wondered where Shakespeare could have seen an example such as this, to know an old man could have so much blood in him.

Burr held the prize out to him. Staring with eyes distended by pressure, his clothing ragged and his torso grinding its broken bones, Burr stalked away from the wall and moved as if to embrace Sollenar. It was strange, but he was not dead.

Shuddering, Sollenar fired again.

Again Burr was thrown back. The ball spun from his splayed fingers as he once more marked the wall with his body.

Pomander, orange, whatever—it looked valuable.

Sollenar ran after the rolling ball. And Burr moved to intercept him, nearly faceless, hunched under a great invisible weight that slowly yielded as his back groaned.

Sollenar took a single backward step.

Burr took a step toward him. The golden ball lay in a far corner. Sollenar raised the pistol despairingly and fired again. Burr tripped backward on tiptoe, his arms like windmills, and fell atop the prize.

Tears ran down Sollenar's cheeks. He pushed one foot forward ... and Burr, in his corner, lifted his head and began to gather his body for the effort of rising.

Sollenar retreated to the window, the pistol hammering backward against his wrist and elbow as he fired the remaining shots in the magazine.

Panting, he climbed up into the window frame and clipped the harness to his body, craning to look over his shoulder ... as Burr—shredded; leaking blood and worse than blood—advanced across the office.

He cast off his holds on the window frame and clumsily worked the drifter controls. Far above him, volatile ballast spilled out and dispersed in the air long before it touched ground. Sollenar rose, sobbing—

And Burr stood in the window, his shattered hands on the edges of the cut circle, raising his distended eyes steadily to watch Sollenar in flight across the enigmatic sky.

---

Where he landed, on the roof of a building he owned, Sollenar had a disposal unit for his gun and his other trappings. He put off answering why Burr hadn't died right away. Empty-handed, he returned uptown.

He entered his office, called, and told his attorneys the exact times he had left and returned, knowing that would take care of dealing with the authorities. That was simple enough, with no witnesses to complicate things. He began to wish he hadn't been so hesitant as to leave Burr without the thing he was after. Surely, if the pistol hadn't killed the man—an old man, with thin limbs and spotted skin—he could have wrestled that thin-limbed, bloody old man aside—that spotted old man—and dragged himself and his prize back to the window, for all that the old man would have clung to him, and clutched at his legs, and fumbled for a handhold on his somber disguise of wrappings—that broken, immortal old man.

Sollenar raised his hand. The great window to the city became opaque.

Bess Allardyce knocked softly on the door from the terrace. He would have thought she'd gone back to her own apartments hours ago. Tortuously pleased, he opened the door and smiled at her, feeling the dried tears crack on the skin of his cheeks.

He took her hands. ""You waited for me,"" he sighed. ""A long time for anyone as beautiful as you to wait.""

She smiled back at him. ""Let's go out and look at the stars.""

""Isn't it chilly?""

""I made spiced hot cider for us. We can sip it and think.""

He let her draw him out onto the terrace. He leaned on the parapet, his arm around her waist, his cape around both their shoulders.

""Bess, I won't ask if you'd stay with me no matter what. But it might be a time will come when I couldn't bear to live in this city. What about that?""

""I don't know,"" she answered honestly.

And Cortwright Burr put his hand up over the edge of the parapet, between them.

Sollenar stared down at the straining knuckles, holding the entire weight of the man dangling against the sheer face of the building. There was a sliding, rustling noise, and the other hand came up, searched blindly for a hold and found it, hooked over the stone. The fingers tensed and rose, their tips flattening at the pressure as Burr tried to pull his head and shoulders up to the level of the parapet.

Bess breathed: ""Oh, look at them! He must have torn them terribly climbing up!"" Then she pulled away from Sollenar and stood staring at him, her hand to her mouth. ""But he _couldn't_ have climbed! We're so high!""

Sollenar beat at the hands with the heels of his palms, using the direct, trained blows he had learned at his athletic club.

Bone splintered against the stone. When the knuckles were broken, the hands instantaneously disappeared, leaving only streaks behind them. Sollenar looked over the parapet. A bundle shrank from sight, silhouetted against the lights of the pedestrian level and the Avenue. It contracted to a pinpoint. Then, when it reached the brook and water flew in all directions, it disappeared in a final sunburst, endowed with glory by the many lights which found momentary reflection down there.

""Bess, leave me! Leave me, please!"" Rufus Sollenar cried out.

---

Rufus Sollenar paced his office, his hands held safely still in front of him, their fingers spread and rigid.

The phone rang, and his secretary said to him: ""Mr. Sollenar, you are ten minutes from being late at the TTV Executives' Ball. This is a First Class obligation.""

Sollenar laughed. ""I thought it was when I originally classified it.""

""Are you now planning to back out, Mr. Sollenar?"" the secretary asked politely.

Certainly, Sollenar thought. He could as easily back out of the Ball as a king could on his coronation.

""Burr, you scum, what have you done to me?"" he asked the air, and the phone said: ""Beg pardon?""

""Tell my valet,"" Sollenar said. ""I'm going."" He dismissed the phone. His hands cupped in front of his chest. A firm grip on emptiness might be stronger than any prize in a broken hand.

Carrying in his chest something he refused to admit was terror, Sollenar made ready for the Ball.

But only a few moments after the first dance set had ended, Malcolm Levier of the local TTV station executive staff looked over Sollenar's shoulder and remarked:

""Oh, there's Cort Burr, dressed like a gallows bird.""

Sollenar, glittering in the costume of the Medici, did not turn his head. ""Is he? What would he want here?""

Levier's eyebrows arched. ""He holds a little stock. He has entree. But he's late."" Levier's lips quirked. ""It must have taken him some time to get that makeup on.""

""Not in good taste, is it?""

""Look for yourself.""

""Oh, I'll do better than that,"" Sollenar said. ""I'll go and talk to him for a while. Excuse me, Levier."" And only then did he turn around, already started on his first pace toward the man.

But Cortwright Burr was only a pasteboard imitation of himself as Sollenar had come to know him. He stood to one side of the doorway, dressed in black and crimson robes, with black leather gauntlets on his hands, carrying a staff of weathered, natural wood. His face was shadowed by a sackcloth hood, the eyes well hidden. His face was powdered gray, and some blend of livid colors hollowed his cheeks. He stood motionless as Sollenar came up to him.

As he had crossed the floor, each step regular, the eyes of bystanders had followed Sollenar, until, anticipating his course, they found Burr waiting. The noise level of the Ball shrank perceptibly, for the lesser revelers who chanced to be present were sustaining it all alone. The people who really mattered here were silent and watchful.

The thought was that Burr, defeated in business, had come here in some insane reproach to his adversary, in this lugubrious, distasteful clothing. Why, he looked like a corpse. Or worse.

The question was, what would Sollenar say to him? The wish was that Burr would take himself away, back to his estates or to some other city. New York was no longer for Cortwright Burr. But what would Sollenar say to him now, to drive him back to where he hadn't the grace to go willingly?

""Cortwright,"" Sollenar said in a voice confined to the two of them. ""So your Martian immortality works.""

Burr said nothing.

""You got that in addition, didn't you? You knew how I'd react. You knew you'd need protection. Paid the Martians to make you physically invulnerable? It's a good system. Very impressive. Who would have thought the Martians knew so much? But who here is going to pay attention to you now? Get out of town, Cortwright. You're past your chance. You're dead as far as these people are concerned—all you have left is your skin.""

Burr reached up and surreptitiously lifted a corner of his fleshed mask. And there he was, under it. The hood retreated an inch, and the light reached his eyes; and Sollenar had been wrong, Burr had less left than he thought.

""Oh, no, no, Cortwright,"" Sollenar said softly. ""No, you're right—I can't stand up to that.""

He turned and bowed to the assembled company. ""Good night!"" he cried, and walked out of the ballroom.

Someone followed him down the corridor to the elevators. Sollenar did not look behind him.

""I have another appointment with you now,"" Ermine said at his elbow.

They reached the pedestrian level. Sollenar said: ""There's a cafe. We can talk there.""

""Too public, Mr. Sollenar. Let's simply stroll and converse."" Ermine lightly took his arm and guided him along the walkway. Sollenar noticed then that Ermine was costumed so cunningly that no one could have guessed the appearance of the man.

""Very well,"" Sollenar said.

""Of course.""

They walked together, casually. Ermine said: ""Burr's driving you to your death. Is it because you tried to kill him earlier? Did you get his Martian secret?""

Sollenar shook his head.

""You didn't get it."" Ermine sighed. ""That's unfortunate. I'll have to take steps.""

""Under the By-Laws,"" Sollenar said, ""I cry _laissez-faire_.""

Ermine looked up, his eyes twinkling. ""_Laissez-faire?_ Mr. Sollenar, do you have any idea how many of our members are involved in your fortunes? _They_ will cry _laissez-faire_, Mr. Sollenar, but clearly you persist in dragging them down with you. No, sir, Mr. Sollenar, my office now forwards an immediate recommendation to the Technical Advisory Committee of the IAB that Mr. Burr probably has a system superior to yours, and that stock in Sollenar, Incorporated, had best be disposed of.""

""There's a bench,"" Sollenar said. ""Let's sit down.""

""As you wish."" Ermine moved beside Sollenar to the bench but remained standing.

""What is it, Mr. Sollenar?""

""I want your help. You advised me on what Burr had. It's still in his office building, somewhere. You have resources. We can get it.""

""_Laissez-faire_, Mr. Sollenar. I visited you in an advisory capacity. I can do no more.""

""For a partnership in my affairs could you do more?""

""Money?"" Ermine tittered. ""For me? Do you know the conditions of my employment?""

If he had thought, Sollenar would have remembered. He reached out tentatively. Ermine anticipated him.

Ermine bared his left arm and sank his teeth into it. He displayed the arm. There was no quiver of pain in voice or stance. ""It's not a legend, Mr. Sollenar. It's quite true. We of our office must spend a year, after the nerve surgery, learning to walk without the feel of our feet, to handle objects without crushing them or letting them slip, or damaging ourselves. Our mundane pleasures are auditory, olfactory, and visual. Easily gratified at little expense. Our dreams are totally interior, Mr. Sollenar. The operation is irreversible. What would you buy for me with your money?""

""What would I buy for myself?"" Sollenar's head sank down between his shoulders.

Ermine bent over him. ""Your despair is your own, Mr. Sollenar. I have official business with you.""

He lifted Sollenar's chin with a forefinger. ""I judge physical interference to be unwarranted at this time. But matters must remain so that the IAB members involved with you can recover the value of their investments in EV. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. Sollenar? You are hereby enjoined under the By-Laws, as enforced by the Special Public Relations Office."" He glanced at his watch. ""Notice was served at 1:27 AM, City time.""

""1:27,"" Sollenar said. ""City time."" He sprang to his feet and raced down a companionway to the taxi level.

Mr. Ermine watched him quizzically.

He opened his costume, took out his omnipresent medical kit, and sprayed coagulant over the wound in his forearm. Replacing the kit, he adjusted his clothing and strolled down the same companionway Sollenar had run. He raised an arm, and a taxi flittered down beside him. He showed the driver a card, and the cab lifted off with him, its lights glaring in a Priority pattern, far faster than Sollenar's ordinary legal limit allowed.

---

Long Island Facility vaulted at the stars with great leaps of arch and cantilever span, sparkling with glass and metal as if the entire port were a mechanism for navigating interplanetary space. Rufus Sollenar paced its esplanades, measuring his steps, holding his arms still, for the short time until he could board the Mars rocket.

Erect and majestic, he took a place in the lounge and carefully sipped liqueur once the liner had boosted away from Earth and engaged its Faraday main drives.

Mr. Ermine settled into the place beside him.

Sollenar looked over at him calmly. ""I thought so.""

Ermine nodded. ""Of course you did. But I didn't almost miss you. I was here ahead of you. I have no objection to your going to Mars, Mr. Sollenar. _Laissez-faire._ Provided I can go along.""

""Well,"" Rufus Sollenar said. ""Liqueur?"" He gestured with his glass.

Ermine shook his head. ""No, thank you,"" he said delicately.

Sollenar said: ""Even your tongue?""

""Of course my tongue, Mr. Sollenar. I taste nothing. I touch nothing."" Ermine smiled. ""But I feel no pressure.""

""All right, then,"" Rufus Sollenar said crisply. ""We have several hours to landing time. You sit and dream your interior dreams, and I'll dream mine."" He faced around in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.

""Mr. Sollenar,"" Ermine said gently.

""Yes?""

""I am once again with you by appointment as provided under the By-Laws.""

""State your business, Mr. Ermine.""

""You are not permitted to lie in an unknown grave, Mr. Sollenar. Insurance policies on your life have been taken out at a high premium rate. The IAB members concerned cannot wait the statutory seven years to have you declared dead. Do what you will, Mr. Sollenar, but I must take care I witness your death. From now on, I am with you wherever you go.""

Sollenar smiled. ""I don't intend to die. Why should I die, Mr. Ermine?""

""I have no idea, Mr. Sollenar. But I know Cortwright Burr's character. And isn't that he, seated there in the corner? The light is poor, but I think he's recognizable.""

Across the lounge, Burr raised his head and looked into Sollenar's eyes. He raised a hand near his face, perhaps merely to signify greeting. Rufus Sollenar faced front.

""A worthy opponent, Mr. Sollenar,"" Ermine said. ""A persevering, unforgiving, ingenious man. And yet—"" Ermine seemed a little touched by bafflement. ""And yet it seems to me, Mr. Sollenar, that he got you running rather easily. What _did_ happen between you, after my advisory call?""

Sollenar turned a terrible smile on Ermine. ""I shot him to pieces. If you'd peel his face, you'd see.""

Ermine sighed. ""Up to this moment, I had thought perhaps you might still salvage your affairs.""

""Pity, Mr. Ermine? Pity for the insane?""

""Interest. I can take no part in your world. Be grateful, Mr. Sollenar. I am not the same gullible man I was when I signed my contract with IAB, so many years ago.""

Sollenar laughed. Then he stole a glance at Burr's corner.

The ship came down at Abernathy Field, in Aresia, the Terrestrial city. Industrialized, prefabricated, jerry-built and clamorous, the storm-proofed buildings huddled, but huddled proudly, at the desert's edge.

Low on the horizon was the Martian settlement—the buildings so skillfully blended with the landscape, so eroded, so much abandoned that the uninformed eye saw nothing. Sollenar had been to Mars—on a tour. He had seen the natives in their nameless dwelling place; arrogant, venomous and weak. He had been told, by the paid guide, they trafficked with Earthmen as much as they cared to, and kept to their place on the rim of Earth's encroachment, observing.

""Tell me, Ermine,"" Sollenar said quietly as they walked across the terminal lobby. ""You're to kill me, aren't you, if I try to go on without you?""

""A matter of procedure, Mr. Sollenar,"" Ermine said evenly. ""We cannot risk the investment capital of so many IAB members.""

Sollenar sighed. ""If I were any other member, how I would commend you, Mr. Ermine! Can we hire a car for ourselves, then, somewhere nearby?""

""Going out to see the engineers?"" Ermine asked. ""Who would have thought they'd have something valuable for sale?""

""I want to show them something,"" Sollenar said.

""What thing, Mr. Sollenar?""

They turned the corner of a corridor, with branching hallways here and there, not all of them busy. ""Come here,"" Sollenar said, nodding toward one of them.

They stopped out of sight of the lobby and the main corridor. ""Come on,"" Sollenar said. ""A little further.""

""No,"" Ermine said. ""This is farther than I really wish. It's dark here.""

""Wise too late, Mr. Ermine,"" Sollenar said, his arms flashing out.

One palm impacted against Ermine's solar plexus, and the other against the muscle at the side of his neck, but not hard enough to kill. Ermine collapsed, starved for oxygen, while Sollenar silently cursed having been cured of murder. Then Sollenar turned and ran.

Behind him, Ermine's body struggled to draw breath by reflex alone.

Moving as fast as he dared, Sollenar walked back and reached the taxi lock, pulling a respirator from a wall rack as he went. He flagged a car and gave his destination, looking behind him. He had seen nothing of Cortwright Burr since setting foot on Mars. But he knew that soon or late, Burr would find him.

A few moments later, Ermine got to his feet. Sollenar's car was well away. Ermine shrugged and went to the local broadcasting station.

He commandeered a private desk, a firearm, and immediate time on the IAB interoffice circuit to Earth. When his call acknowledgment had come back to him from his office there, he reported:

""Sollenar is en route to the Martian city. He wants a duplicate of Burr's device, of course, since he smashed the original when he killed Burr. I'll follow and make final disposition. The disorientation I reported previously is progressing rapidly. Almost all his responses now are inappropriate. On the flight out, he seemed to be staring at something in an empty seat. Quite often when spoken to he obviously hears something else entirely. I expect to catch one of the next few flights back.""

There was no point in waiting for comment to wend its way back from Earth. Ermine left. He went to a cab rank and paid the exorbitant fee for transportation outside Aresian city limits.

Close at hand, the Martian city was like a welter of broken pots. Shards of wall and roof joined at savage angles and pointed to nothing. Underfoot, drifts of vitreous material, shaped to fit no sane configuration, and broken to fit such a mosaic as no church would contain, rocked and slid under Sollenar's hurrying feet.

What from Aresia had been a solid front of dun color was here a facade of red, green and blue splashed about centuries ago and since then weathered only enough to show how bitter the colors had once been. The plum-colored sky stretched over all this like a frigid membrane, and the wind blew and blew.

Here and there, as he progressed, Sollenar saw Martian arms and heads protruding from the rubble. Sculptures.

He was moving toward the heart of the city, where some few unbroken structures persisted. At the top of a heap of shards, he turned to look behind him. There was the dust-plume of his cab, returning to the city. He expected to walk back—perhaps to meet someone on the road, all alone on the Martian plain if only Ermine would forbear from interfering. Searching the flat, thin-aired landscape, he tried to pick out the plodding dot of Cortwright Burr. But not yet.

He turned and ran down the untrustworthy slope.

He reached the edge of the maintained area. Here the rubble was gone, the ancient walks swept, the statues kept upright on their pedestals. But only broken walls suggested the fronts of the houses that had stood here. Knifing their sides up through the wind-rippled sand that only constant care kept off the street, the shadow-houses fenced his way and the sculptures were motionless as hope. Ahead of him, he saw the buildings of the engineers. There was no heap to climb and look to see if Ermine followed close behind.

Sucking his respirator, he reached the building of the Martian engineers.

A sounding strip ran down the doorjamb. He scratched his fingernails sharply along it, and the magnified vibration, ducted throughout the hollow walls, rattled his plea for entrance.

The door opened, and Martians stood looking. They were spindly-limbed and slight, their faces framed by folds of leathery tissue. Their mouths were lipped with horn as hard as dentures, and pursed, forever ready to masticate. They were pleasant neither to look at nor, Sollenar knew, to deal with. But Cortwright Burr had done it. And Sollenar needed to do it.

""Does anyone here speak English?"" he asked.

""I,"" said the central Martian, his mouth opening to the sound, closing to end the reply.

""I would like to deal with you.""

""Whenever,"" the Martian said, and the group at the doorway parted deliberately to let Sollenar in.

Before the door closed behind him, Sollenar looked back. But the rubble of the abandoned sectors blocked his line of sight into the desert.

""What can you offer? And what do you want?"" the Martian asked. Sollenar stood half-ringed by them, in a room whose corners he could not see in the uncertain light.

""I offer you Terrestrial currency.""

The English-speaking Martian—the Martian who had admitted to speaking English—turned his head slightly and spoke to his fellows. There were clacking sounds as his lips met. The others reacted variously, one of them suddenly gesturing with what seemed a disgusted flip of his arm before he turned without further word and stalked away, his shoulders looking like the shawled back of a very old and very hungry woman.

""What did Burr give you?"" Sollenar asked.

""Burr."" The Martian cocked his head. His eyes were not multi-faceted, but gave that impression.

""He was here, and he dealt with you. Not long ago. On what basis?""

""Burr. Yes. Burr gave us currency. We will take currency from you. For the same thing we gave him?""

""For immortality, yes.""

""Im—This is a new word.""

""Is it? For the secret of not dying?""

""Not dying? You think we have not-dying for sale here?"" The Martian spoke to the others again. Their lips clattered. Others left, like the first one had, moving with great precision and very slow step, and no remaining tolerance for Sollenar.

Sollenar cried out: ""What did you sell him, then?""

The principal engineer said: ""We made an entertainment device for him.""

""A little thing. This size."" Sollenar cupped his hands.

""You have seen it, then.""

""Yes. And nothing more? That was all he bought here?""

""It was all we had to sell—or give. We don't yet know whether Earthmen will give us things in exchange for currency. We'll see, when we next need something from Aresia.""

Sollenar demanded: ""How did it work? This thing you sold him.""

""Oh, it lets people tell stories to themselves.""

Sollenar looked closely at the Martian. ""What kind of stories?""

""Any kind,"" the Martian said blandly. ""Burr told us what he wanted. He had drawings with him of an Earthman device that used pictures on a screen and broadcast sounds, to carry the details of the story told to the auditor.""

""He stole those patents! He couldn't have used them on Earth.""

""And why should he? Our device needs to convey no precise details. Any mind can make its own. It only needs to be put into a situation, and from there it can do all the work. If an auditor wishes a story of contact with other sexes, for example, the projector simply makes it seem to him, the next time he is with the object of his desire, that he is getting positive feedback—that he is arousing a similar response in that object. Once that has been established for him, the auditor may then leave the machine, move about normally, conduct his life as usual—but always in accordance with the basic situation. It is, you see, in the end a means of introducing system into his view of reality. Of course, his society must understand that he is not in accord with reality, for some of what he does cannot seem rational from an outside view of him. So some care must be taken, but not much. If many such devices were to enter his society, soon the circumstances would become commonplace, and the society would surely readjust to allow for it,"" said the English-speaking Martian.

""The machine creates any desired situation in the auditor's mind?""

""Certainly. There are simple predisposing tapes that can be inserted as desired. Love, adventure, cerebration—it makes no difference.""

Several of the bystanders clacked sounds out to each other. Sollenar looked at them narrowly. It was obvious there had to be more than one English-speaker among these people.

""And the device you gave Burr,"" he asked the engineer, neither calmly nor hopefully. ""What sort of stories could its auditors tell themselves?""

The Martian cocked his head again. It gave him the look of an owl at a bedroom window. ""Oh, there was one situation we were particularly instructed to include. Burr said he was thinking ahead to showing it to an acquaintance of his.

""It was a situation of adventure; of adventure with the fearful. And it was to end in loss and bitterness."" The Martian looked even more closely at Sollenar. ""Of course, the device does not specify details. No one but the auditor can know what fearful thing inhabits his story, or precisely how the end of it would come. You would, I believe, be Rufus Sollenar? Burr spoke of you and made the noise of laughing.""

Sollenar opened his mouth. But there was nothing to say.

""You want such a device?"" the Martian asked. ""We've prepared several since Burr left. He spoke of machines that would manufacture them in astronomical numbers. We, of course, have done our best with our poor hands.""

Sollenar said: ""I would like to look out your door.""

""Pleasure.""

Sollenar opened the door slightly. Mr. Ermine stood in the cleared street, motionless as the shadow buildings behind him. He raised one hand in a gesture of unfelt greeting as he saw Sollenar, then put it back on the stock of his rifle. Sollenar closed the door and turned to the Martian. ""How much currency do you want?""

""Oh, all you have with you. You people always have a good deal with you when you travel.""

Sollenar plunged his hands into his pockets and pulled out his billfold, his change, his keys, his jeweled radio; whatever was there, he rummaged out onto the floor, listening to the sound of rolling coins.

""I wish I had more here,"" he laughed. ""I wish I had the amount that man out there is going to recover when he shoots me.""

The Martian engineer cocked his head. ""But your dream is over, Mr. Sollenar,"" he clacked dryly. ""Isn't it?""

""Quite so. But you to your purposes and I to mine. Now give me one of those projectors. And set it to predispose a situation I am about to specify to you. Take however long it needs. The audience is a patient one."" He laughed, and tears gathered in his eyes.

Mr. Ermine waited, isolated from the cold, listening to hear whether the rifle stock was slipping out of his fingers. He had no desire to go into the Martian building after Sollenar and involve third parties. All he wanted was to put Sollenar's body under a dated marker, with as little trouble as possible.

Now and then he walked a few paces backward and forward, to keep from losing muscular control at his extremities because of low skin temperature. Sollenar must come out soon enough. He had no food supply with him, and though Ermine did not like the risk of engaging a man like Sollenar in a starvation contest, there was no doubt that a man with no taste for fuel could outlast one with the acquired reflexes of eating.

The door opened, and Sollenar came out.

He was carrying something. Perhaps a weapon. Ermine let him come closer while he raised and carefully sighted his rifle. Sollenar might have some Martian weapon or he might not. Ermine did not particularly care. If Ermine died, he would hardly notice it—far less than he would notice a botched ending to a job of work already roiled by Sollenar's break away at the space field. If Ermine died, some other SPRO agent would be assigned almost immediately. No matter what happened, SPRO would stop Sollenar before he ever reached Abernathy Field.

So there was plenty of time to aim an unhurried, clean shot.

Sollenar was closer now. He seemed to be in a very agitated frame of mind. He held out whatever he had in his hand.

It was another one of the Martian entertainment machines. Sollenar seemed to be offering it as a token to Ermine. Ermine smiled.

""What can you offer me, Mr. Sollenar?"" he said, and shot.

The golden ball rolled away over the sand. ""There, now,"" Ermine said. ""_Now_, wouldn't you sooner be me than you? And where is the thing that made the difference between us?""

He shivered. He was chilly. Sand was blowing against his tender face, which had been somewhat abraded during his long wait.

He stopped, transfixed.

He lifted his head.

Then, with a great swing of his arms, he sent the rifle whirling away. ""The wind!"" he sighed into the thin air. ""I feel the wind."" He leapt into the air, and sand flew away from his feet as he landed. He whispered to himself: ""I feel the ground!""

He stared in trembling joy at Sollenar's empty body. ""What have you given me?"" Full of his own rebirth, he swung his head up at the sky again, and cried in the direction of the Sun: ""Oh, you squeezing, nibbling people who made me incorruptible and thought that was the end of me!""

With love, he buried Sollenar, and with reverence, he put up the marker, but he had plans for what he might accomplish with the facts of this transaction, and the myriad others he was privy to.

A sharp bit of pottery had penetrated the sole of his shoe and gashed his foot, but he, not having seen it, hadn't felt it. Nor would he see it or feel it even when he changed his stockings; for he had not noticed the wound when it was made. It didn't matter. In a few days, it would heal, though not as rapidly as if it had been properly attended to.

Vaguely, he heard the sound of Martians clacking behind their closed door as he hurried out of the city, full of revenge, and reverence for his savior.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Rufus Sollenar's struggle with his own ambitions and the consequences of his actions. Sollenar, a man who sells dreams and controls a powerful video system, EmpaVid, becomes entangled in a rivalry with Cortwright Burr, who has acquired a mysterious, potentially superior technology from Martian engineers. This rivalry pushes Sollenar to the brink, leading him to attempt murder to secure his position and eliminate Burr as a threat.

However, Sollenar's internal conflict is his inability to recognize and learn from his personal shortcomings and moral failings. Despite his success and power, he is plagued by insecurity and fear of losing control. This fear drives him to desperate actions, such as the attempted murder of Burr, which ultimately lead to his downfall.

The external conflict is further complicated by the intervention of Mr. Ermine, a representative of the Special Public Relations Office, who is tasked with ensuring that the investments of IAB members in Sollenar's ventures are protected. Ermine's presence adds pressure on Sollenar, as he represents the interests of those who have a stake in Sollenar's success or failure.

In the end, the story highlights the themes of ambition, rivalry, the quest for power, and the human tendency to overlook personal growth in favor of external success. The conflict culminates in Sollenar's demise and Ermine's unexpected transformation, underscoring the unpredictable nature of ambition and the consequences of one's actions.","Would you risk everything to control the world's dreams, even if it meant losing your own?","Would you eliminate your competition to secure your empire, even if it meant losing your humanity?",Imagine the power to orchestrate a whole city's feelings—what if the only emotion left is fear?,science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,Who is Rufus Sollenar?,Rufus Sollenar is a man who sells dreams and controls a powerful video system called EmpaVid.,Why does Mr. Ermine visit Sollenar?,"Mr. Ermine visits Sollenar to advise him about the potential risks and implications of his business dealings with EmpaVid, especially concerning the involvement of Cortwright Burr and the Martians.",What might happen if Sollenar's EmpaVid system fails?,"If Sollenar's EmpaVid system fails, it could lead to significant financial losses for many IAB members and potentially ruin Sollenar's corporation, causing embarrassment and financial instability.",How does Sollenar's perception of control change throughout the story?,"Initially, Sollenar feels in control and triumphant, having secured EmpaVid and a powerful position.

055.txt,"Sally watched the sunset in the sky. She realized she would never see her son and husband again on Earth.

Sally Anders never thought of herself as shy. A girl could be quiet and still be pretty enough to catch a man's eye, right? Just this morning, the milkman had given her an admiring glance, and Jimmy, the paperboy, had whistled at her. So what if the milkman was nearly sixty and wore thick glasses? And Jimmy was only seventeen? A man was a man, and a look was a look. ""If I just dress up a bit more,"" Sally thought, ""I'll be irresistible.""

With hair ribbons, perfume, a tilted mirror, and a party invitation, what more could a girl want? ""Dinner, Sally!"" called her mother from the kitchen. ""Do you want to be late, child?"" Sally had no intention of being late. Tonight she'd see him across a crowded room, and her heart would skip a beat. He'd smile at her and walk straight over with his shoulders squared.

There was always one night in a girl’s life that stood out. A night when the moon was bright, and the clock went tick-tock, tick-tock. A night when each tick said, ""You’re beautiful! Really beautiful!"" Sally gave her hair one last pat and smiled at herself in the mirror.

In the bathroom, the water was running, and the perfumed bath soap scented the room. Sally turned off the tap before going downstairs. ""My girl looks radiant tonight!"" Uncle Ben said, smiling over his corned beef and cabbage. Sally blushed and lowered her eyes. ""Ben, you're making her nervous,"" her mother laughed. Sally met her uncle's eyes defiantly. ""I'm not bad-looking,"" she said. ""Oh, now, Sally,"" Uncle Ben protested. ""Tonight, you might find a man who can't resist you.""

""Maybe I will, maybe I won't,"" Sally said. ""You'd be surprised if I did, wouldn't you?"" Uncle Ben lowered his eyes. ""You've inherited your mother's looks, Sally,"" he said. ""But a man has to pride himself on something.""

Sally folded her napkin and rose from the table. ""Good night, Uncle,"" she said. When Sally arrived at the party, the dance floor was crowded. As each guest was announced, a ripple of displeasure went through the people.

Sally didn't move, just watched the dancers. Moonlight touched her hair and arms gently. By closing her eyes, she could imagine herself in his arms. Moonlight from tall windows made the dancers look like ghosts.

""Close your eyes, Sally, tight! Now open them! Slowly..."" He appeared beside her suddenly. He was tall, with a tanned face and bright eyes. He looked at her until her mouth opened in a little gasp. He took her into his arms without a word, and they started to dance.

They were still dancing when he asked her to marry him. ""You'll marry me, won't you? We don't have much time. The years go by swiftly, like great white birds at sea."" They were close when he asked her, but he didn’t attempt to kiss her. They danced on, and he talked about the moon. ""The moon remains when the lights go out and the music stops,"" he said. ""It raises tides on Earth and stirs men's minds and hearts.""

He stopped dancing and looked at her calmly. ""You will marry me, won't you? I doubt I could be happy with anyone else. I was drawn to you the moment I saw you.""

Sally, who had never been asked before, could hardly resist. ""Don’t resist, Sally. He’s strong, tall, and handsome. He knows what he wants and decides quickly. Surely he can support a wife."" ""Yes,"" Sally said, snuggling close. ""Oh, yes!"" She paused, then said, ""You may kiss me now, my darling.""

He straightened and frowned a little. ""That can wait,"" he said.

* * *

They married a week later and lived on an elm-shaded street five blocks from where Sally was born. The cottage was small and white, but Sally changed the curtains and bought new furniture on installment.

The neighbors knew her husband as Mr. James Rand, a young insurance broker who would do well in his profession with a charming wife. Ten months later, the first baby came.

Lying in the hospital, Sally felt happy. The baby was beautiful and cuddled close to her heart. Other husbands sat by their wives, holding their happiness. Out in the corridor, the husbands congratulated each other. ""Have a cigar! Eight pounds at birth. Knew his old man right off.""

He was suddenly beside her, standing straight and still. ""Oh, darling,"" she whispered. ""Why did you wait? It's been three days."" ""Three days?"" he asked, leaning to stare at his son. ""It didn't seem that long."" ""Where were you? You didn't even phone!"" ""Sometimes it's hard to phone,"" he said slowly. ""You’ve given me a son. That pleases me.""

A coldness touched her heart. ""It pleases you! Is that all? You look at me as if I were a patient."" ""A patient? What do you mean, Sally?"" ""You said you were pleased. When a woman has a baby, her husband holds her close. If they love each other, they cry with happiness.""

""I am too pleased to cry,"" he said. ""When a child is born, no tears should be shed by its parents. I have examined the child, and I am pleased. Isn’t that enough?""

""No, it isn't!"" Sally cried. ""Why do you look at your son as if you'd never seen a baby before? He’s not a toy. He’s our child! How can you be so calm?"" He frowned and put the baby down. ""There is a time for love-making and a time for parenthood,"" he said. ""Parenthood is a serious responsibility.""

Sally’s mouth went dry. ""Perfect! What do you mean, Jim? Is there something wrong with Tommy?"" ""I don't think so,"" her husband said. ""His grasp is firm. His eyesight is good. Did you notice how his eyes followed me?"" ""I wasn't looking at his eyes!"" Sally whispered. ""Why are you trying to frighten me, Jim? If Tommy wasn't a normal, healthy baby, would they have given him to me?""

""That’s a sound observation,"" her husband said. ""To alarm you would be cruel.""

""Where does that put you?""

""I simply spoke my mind as the child's father. Do you want me to stay and talk to you, Sally?""

Sally shook her head. ""No, Jim. I won’t let you torture me anymore."" Sally drew the baby into her arms. ""I'll scream if you stay! I'll become hysterical."" ""Very well,"" her husband said. ""I'll come back tomorrow."" He bent and kissed her forehead. His lips were ice-cold.

For eight years, Sally sat across the breakfast table from her husband. He cracked his eggs methodically and read the newspaper, sipping coffee. ""Eat slowly, Tommy,"" he'd say to their son. ""Take plenty of exercise today.""

Often Sally wanted to yell, ""Be a father to him! Get down on the floor and play with him. Break the train you gave him. He'll feel close to you then.""

Often Sally wanted to beat her fists on his chest. But she never did.

""You can’t warm a stone by slapping it, Sally. You’d only bruise yourself. You’ve married a man of stone.""

He never missed a day at the office. She never visited, but he always answered the phone. ""I’m busy, Sally. What did you say? You bought a new hat? I’m sure it will look well on you. Tommy got into a fight? You must take better care of him, Sally.""

There are patterns in every marriage. ""I’ll drop in at the office tomorrow,"" Sally had promised. But he asked her to wait. Over time, he talked her out of it.

Tommy took up her time. A growing boy was always a problem, and Tommy was active. He wore out his shoes almost faster than she could replace them.

Tommy was playing in the yard. Sally’s eyes focused on him crouching by a hole in the fence. Mrs. Wallingford had erected the fence to protect her privacy from an inquisitive eight-year-old. A thrice-widowed neighbor of seventy could put up with a boy who rollicked and yelled. But spying was another matter.

Sally muttered, ""Enough of that!"" and started for the door. Just then, the telephone rang.

Sally went quickly to the phone and lifted the receiver. She recognized her husband’s voice — or thought she did.

""Sally, come to the office!"" he said hoarsely. ""Hurry — or it will be too late! Hurry, Sally!""

Sally turned with a startled gasp and looked out the window at the autumn leaves. As she looked, they whirled around Tommy, then lifted and spun over the fence.

The dread in her heart turned to despair. She didn’t pause to call Tommy in. She rushed upstairs, then down again, grabbing her hat, gloves, and purse.

The ride to the office was a nightmare. Tall buildings swept past, granite facades gray as the skies of mid-winter. Despite Tommy, despite everything, there was no vision to warm Sally from within. A cottage must be lived in to become a home, and Sally had never really had a home.

One-night stand! It wasn’t an expression she’d use, but it came to mind. If you live for nine years with a man who can’t be warm and loving, you’ll feel you might as well live alone. Each day had been like a lonely outpost for Sally.

She thought about Tommy. Tommy wasn’t like his father when he came home from school, hair tousled. Tommy would raid the pantry, invite boys to watch TV, and trade black eyes for marbles.

But she had seen in Tommy’s eyes the same calmness as his father’s, and it filled her with terror. Tommy, her son. Tommy, no longer boisterous, but sitting in a corner. Tommy staring out the window at blackbirds on the wing.

""This is the address you gave me, lady. Sixty-seven Vine Street,"" the cab driver said.

Sally shivered, remembering her husband’s voice on the phone. ""Come to the office, Sally! Hurry, hurry — or it will be too late!""

Too late for what? To recapture happiness she never had?

""This is it, lady!"" the cab driver insisted. ""Do you want me to wait?""

""No,"" Sally said, fumbling for change. She paid the driver and hurried across the pavement to the office building.

The firm’s name was on the directory board. The elevator opened, and Sally was whisked up eight stories.

""Eighth floor!"" Sally whispered in alarm. The elevator jolted to a halt, and the operator glared at her.

""You should have told me when you got on, Miss!"" he complained.

""Sorry,"" Sally muttered, stumbling into the corridor. How horrible it must be to go to business every day, she thought. To sit in an office, to thumb through papers, to be a machine.

Sally felt her sanity threatened by the thought. People who worked in offices could look forward to going home at five o’clock.

But for Sally, the brightness was withheld. The corridor was wide and deserted, the black tiles with gold borders hemming her into a cool magnificence.

She found the office, her mind working against the dread. Steady, Sally! Here’s the office, here’s the door. Turn the knob and get it over with.

Sally opened the door and stepped into a small reception room. Beyond the desk was a gate, and beyond the gate, a large central office branched off into smaller offices.

Sally paused only a moment. It seemed natural that a business office would be deserted so late.

She crossed the reception room, passed through the gate, and desperation gave her courage.

She felt she only had to open the first door to find her husband.

The first door combined privacy with easy accessibility. As soon as she opened it, she knew she had been right to trust her instincts. This was his office.

He sat at a desk by the window. His elbows rested on the desk, and his hands were tightly locked as if he had just stopped wringing them.

He looked straight at her, his eyes wide and staring.

""Jim!"" Sally breathed. ""Jim, what’s wrong?""

He didn’t answer, didn’t move. His face was colorless. His lips were parted, his teeth gleamed. His control was so intense that for once, Sally felt more alarm than bitterness.

There was rising terror in her. The sunlight streamed in, gleaming redly on his hair, his shoulders. He seemed to be the center of a flaming red ball.

He sent for you, Sally. Why doesn’t he speak to you, if only to pour salt on the wounds you’ve borne for eight years?

Poor Sally! You wanted a strong, protective husband. What have you got instead?

Sally went up to the desk and looked steadily into his calm eyes. For a moment, her terror ebbed. Then she made the mistake of brushing his elbow with her sleeve.

That single light touch unsettled him. He started to fall, sideways and fast. A dead weight crashes with a swiftness no force can counterbalance.

It did Sally no good to clutch at his arm as he fell. His descending bulk dragged him down, the awful inertia of lifeless flesh.

He thudded to the floor and rolled over, his jaw hanging open on the gaping black orifice of his mouth.

Sally might have screamed and kept screaming if she had been a different kind of woman. On seeing her husband lying dead, her impulse might have been to throw herself down, give way to grief.

But where there was no grief, there could be no sobbing.

One thing she did before she left. She unloosed the collar and looked for the small brown mole on his shoulder. The mole she knew to be on her husband’s shoulder.

She had noticed things that made her doubt her sanity; she needed to see the mole to reassure her.

She had noticed the difference in the hairline, the strange slant of the eyebrows, the crinkly texture of the skin.

Something was wrong, horribly wrong.

Even the hands seemed larger and hairier than her husband’s. Nevertheless, it was important to be sure.

The absence of the mole clinched it.

Sally crouched beside the body, readjusting the collar. Then she walked out of the office.

Some homecomings are joyful, others cruel. Sally had no plan, no hope that was more than a dim flickering.

But it was strange how one light burning in a cottage window could make a wasteland seem small.

The light was in Tommy’s room, and there was whispering behind the door. Sally could hear it as she tiptoed upstairs.

She paused at the stairs, listening. There were two voices in the room, talking back and forth.

Sally tiptoed down the hall, stood outside the door.

""She knows now, Tommy,"" the deepest voice said. ""We are close, your mother and I. She knows I sent her to the office to find my 'stand-in.' It’s an Earth term we wouldn’t use on Mars, but it’s a term your mother would understand.""

A pause, then, ""You see, my son, it has taken me eight years to repair the ship. A man can wither up if he does not have a son to go adventuring with him.""

""Adventuring, father?""

""You have read Earth books, written for boys. What paltry books they are! But in them is a little of the glow of our world.""

""No, father. I started them but threw them away.""

""As you and I must throw away all Earth things, my son. I tried to be kind to your mother, to be a good husband. But how could I share her joys and sorrows? Can an eagle pretend to be a sparrow?""

""You tried, father.""

""Yes, my son. Without her, I could not have had you.""

""And now, father, what will we do?""

""The ship has been repaired and is waiting. I worked on it every day for eight years.""

""You never went to the office, father?""

""No, my son. My stand-in worked there. I made your mother dislike the office to keep her from meeting the stand-in. But now she has gone.""

""Was constructing the stand-in difficult?""

""Not for me, my son. On Mars, we have many androids, each for a specific task.""

""I will miss my mother.""

""You must be brave. We are eagles, you and I. I shall remember her with tenderness. You want to go with me?""

""Yes, father. Oh, yes!""

""Then come, my son. We must hurry.""

Sally listened like a spectator before a TV screen. She could see her son’s face so clearly there was no need to move.

The door opened, and Tommy and his father came into the hall. Sally stepped back into shadows and watched them walk quickly down the hall to the stairs. She heard them descend.

You’ll see a light, Sally, a great glow lighting up the sky. The ship must be very beautiful. He was calm toward you, but not toward the ship, Sally — the ship which will take him back to Mars!

How is it on Mars, she wondered. My son, Tommy, will become a proud adventurer daring the farthest planet?

You can’t stop a boy from adventuring. Surprise him at his books, and you’ll see tropical seas in his eyes.

There is no strength like a mother’s, Sally. Endure it, be brave...

Sally was at the window when it came. A dazzling burst of radiance, starting from the horizon and spreading across the sky. It lit up the cottage, turning rooftops to molten gold.

Brighter it grew, gilding Sally’s bowed head and her image on the pane. Then, abruptly, it was gone.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Sally's struggle with her marriage and her perception of reality. Initially, she is infatuated with the idea of love and marriage, idealizing her husband despite his emotional distance and cold demeanor. Over time, she becomes increasingly aware of the disconnect between her expectations of a loving family and the reality of her husband's detachment and mysterious behavior.

The dilemma intensifies when Sally is confronted with evidence that her husband is not who he appears to be. This revelation culminates in her discovery that her husband is an alien who has been preparing to return to Mars with their son, Tommy. Sally faces the painful realization that her life with him was based on an illusion, and she is left to grapple with the profound loss of her son, who chooses to leave Earth with his father.

057.txt,"Once upon a time, in the sea, there was a Whale. This Whale ate all kinds of fish, like starfish, garfish, crabs, and eels, to name a few. He ate so many fish that only one small fish was left, and it was a clever fish called the 'Stute Fish. The 'Stute Fish swam behind the Whale's right ear to stay safe. The Whale felt hungry and asked the 'Stute Fish if he had ever tasted Man. The 'Stute Fish said Man was tasty but a bit bumpy.

The Whale wanted to try Man, so the 'Stute Fish told him to swim to a certain spot, latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West, where he would find a shipwrecked Sailor on a raft. The Whale swam there and found the Sailor, who only wore blue canvas pants, suspenders, and had a jack-knife. The Whale opened his mouth wide and swallowed the Sailor, his raft, pants, suspenders, and jack-knife, all at once.

Inside the Whale, the Sailor, who was very smart, started making a fuss. He stomped, jumped, and made noise, which made the Whale uncomfortable. The Whale, with hiccups, asked the 'Stute Fish what to do. The 'Stute Fish suggested telling the Sailor to come out. The Whale did so, but the Sailor refused, demanding to be taken back to his home. The Whale agreed and swam back, releasing the Sailor on his home shore.

While inside the Whale, the Sailor had made a grating from his raft and suspenders, which he stuck in the Whale's throat. Because of this, the Whale could only eat very small fish from then on, and that's why whales today don't eat people.

The Whale and the 'Stute Fish became friends again, and the Sailor went home to live happily ever after. That's the end of the story.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the Whale's desire to try new food—specifically, a human—which leads to unintended consequences. The Whale, driven by curiosity and hunger, swallows a Sailor whole, along with his belongings. This action creates a dilemma for the Whale, as the Sailor, being resourceful and clever, causes discomfort inside the Whale by making noise and creating a ruckus. 

The Whale's initial conflict is with his own desire to eat something new, but it quickly shifts to dealing with the consequences of swallowing the Sailor. The resolution involves negotiating with the Sailor, who demands to be taken back home in exchange for ceasing his disruptive behavior. This results in the Sailor crafting a grating that permanently changes the Whale's eating habits, forcing him to only consume small fish henceforth.

The story's conflict is resolved through negotiation and compromise, leading to a change in the Whale's behavior and a newfound friendship with the 'Stute Fish. The resolution underscores themes of cleverness, consequences of one's actions, and the importance of peaceful coexistence.",You're a whale who just ate a sailor by mistake.

058.txt,"One cold winter afternoon, when the sun was shining brightly after a long storm, two children asked their mother if they could go outside and play in the fresh snow. The older child was a little girl named Violet. She was gentle and shy, and everyone thought she was very beautiful. Her brother, Peony, got his name because his round, rosy face reminded everyone of bright flowers.

Their father, Mr. Lindsey, was a practical man who sold hardware. He was kind, but he usually saw things in a straightforward way. Their mother, on the other hand, still kept a bit of the imagination and beauty she had from when she was young.

""Yes, Violet, and yes, my little Peony,"" their mother said kindly. ""You can go out and play in the new snow.""

She bundled them up warmly and kissed them before they went out to play. Soon, the children were having a great time in the garden, which was now covered in snow.

After playing for a while, Violet had an idea. ""You look like a snow-image, Peony,"" she said, ""except your cheeks are too red. Let's make a snow-girl and pretend she's our sister!""

Peony was excited about the idea, and they began to build a snow-girl. Their mother watched from the window, smiling at how serious they were about their new project. The children thought it would be easy to make a real snow-girl who could play with them.

The mother thought about how wonderful it would be if fairies or angels helped the children make their snow-girl. As she watched, the snow-image began to look more and more like a real little girl.

The children chatted happily as they worked, and their mother loved hearing their voices. They talked about how beautiful their snow-sister was and imagined her coming to life.

Finally, when the snow-girl was finished, the children called to their mother to come and see. She looked out and saw, to her amazement, what seemed to be a real little girl playing with Violet and Peony in the garden. She wondered if it was a neighbor's child or if it could possibly be the snow-image come to life.

The snow-girl seemed happy to play in the cold, and the children were delighted with their new playmate. But when their father came home, he was worried about the little girl being out in the cold with only a thin dress and slippers. He said they should bring her inside to warm up.

Violet and Peony begged him not to bring their snow-sister inside, knowing she would melt. But their father, thinking he was doing the right thing, brought her into the warm house. As soon as she stepped inside, she began to melt away, leaving only a little puddle of water.

The children were heartbroken, and their father was confused by what had happened. But their mother, with her imagination and belief in miracles, understood that their snow-girl could only exist in the cold and was sad but also proud of the magical time the children had with their snow-sister.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the clash between imagination and practicality, embodied in the magical creation of the snow-girl and the differing perspectives of the family members. The children, Violet and Peony, along with their mother, embrace imagination and the possibility of magic, as they bring to life a snow-girl who becomes their playmate. This sense of wonder and belief in the extraordinary contrasts with the practical and straightforward nature of their father, Mr. Lindsey, who is concerned with the snow-girl's wellbeing in the cold.

The dilemma intensifies when Mr. Lindsey, acting out of concern, decides to bring the snow-girl inside to warm up, unaware that doing so would cause her to melt. This decision highlights the tension between the father's practical intention to protect and the children's and mother's understanding of the snow-girl's magical nature, which thrives only in the cold.

Ultimately, the story explores the themes of imagination versus practicality, the transient nature of magic, and the bittersweet beauty of ephemeral moments. It leaves the children heartbroken by the loss of their snow-sister, yet it also underscores the mother's acceptance and pride in the magical experience they shared, despite its brief existence.","What if your imaginary friend came to life, but your dad's love could make her disappear forever?",What happens when your magical snow-sister meets the warmth of your dad's love?

061.txt,"Under the new system of the Managerials, the fight was not for life but for death! And great was the ingenuity of--The Victor.

Charles Marquis had just a few seconds to die. He fell through the metal beams and hung there, five thousand feet above the walkways below. At both ends of the walkway connecting two large buildings, security officers were running toward him.

He smiled and prepared to let go. He would think about them on the way down. But his fingers wouldn't move. He struggled and pulled with his own weight, but his hands wouldn't release. They were frozen to the metal by some kind of paralysis beam.

He hung there, defeated for a moment. But then the fire inside him burned stronger. Maybe it was that strong will that kept him going when others would give up. As the paralysis left his arms, he was lifted and helped along the walkway to a security car.

The car looked like any other, and the officers seemed like everyone else in the orderly world of the New System. Marquis closed his eyes as the car sped through the air. He had worked with the Underground against the System for a long time, knowing he'd eventually be caught. People whispered about what happened to prisoners, and even the rumors were enough to make death seem better than what they faced. The Underground believed it was better to die standing as a free man than to live as a controlled slave.

He had failed this time, but he wasn't finished yet. In a hollow tooth was a capsule of poison. It could kill him quickly, but he had to wait for the right time.

---

The Manager was thin and matched the steel angles of the desk and the room. His face was cold and superior.

""We don't get many like you,"" he said. ""Political prisoners are rare now. From now on, you're No. 5274.""

He looked at some papers and back at Marquis. ""You found out a lot. But it won't help you or your Underground friends."" The Manager studied Marquis with curiosity. ""You learned secrets about the Managerials.""

It was partly a question. Marquis smiled slightly. ""Yes, we suspected it for a while. The Managerial class has found a way to stay young—either living a long time or being immortal. Keeping such a secret from the people is the worst evil.""

The Manager nodded. ""So you did find out? The Underground knows? It won't help them.""

""It will eventually. They'll keep trying and find the secret,"" Marquis thought of Marden. Marden was as old as the New System, 303 years old.

The Manager said, ""No. 5274, you'll be sent to the Moon's work colony. You won't come back. We tried re-conditioning rebels, but it doesn't work. On the Moon, you'll conform. It's a social experiment in our culture. You'll conform.""

He was taken to a small, gray room. He thought about using the poison now but decided against it. They might save him and he wouldn't get another chance. He didn't know much about what was coming, except it would be horrible.

He heard a pellet fall, then saw a gas fill the room. He didn't taste or smell anything, and he passed out quickly.

---

He was marched into another office and knew he was on the Moon. The far wall was part of the pressure dome that kept out the extreme cold and heat. Outside, he could see the shadows on the crater wall.

This Manager was fatter, with a round face and cold blue eyes. He sat behind a chrome shelf hanging from the ceiling.

The Manager said, ""No. 5274, here there is only work. At first, you'll resist. Later you'll work, and finally, nothing else will matter. We are developing a perfect society here, a kind of experiment. We test how far we can use our mastery to bring man security and happiness.""

Marquis didn't say anything. He knew he couldn't kill this Manager. But a rebel could beat the system. He had to!

""Our work is specialized here. During the indoctrination, you'll do simple jobs with the machines. Later, because of your knowledge of food-concentrate preparation, you'll move to the food-mart. The indoctrination varies. You'll be screened and taken to the indoctrination ward. We probably won't see each other again. The bells and machines handle everything. Machines don't make mistakes.""

He was marched through a series of rooms, past generators and machines. He was spun and squeezed through wires and panels.

""... here machine and man learn to work very intimately together.""

As he drifted through, Marquis knew what he had been fighting—losing one's identity and becoming part of an assembly line.

He heard a clicking sound, a rhythm like his heartbeat.

""... the machines and the nervous system of the workers become slowly cooperative.""

Beds were lined up ten feet apart down a long hall. There were no cells, no privacy, just beds and gray suits with numbers.

His bed was shown to him, and the guard left. It was silent. On his right, a woman lay on a bed, No. 329. She had been there a long time, appearing dead. Her breathing was steady, in sync with the walls. She might have been attractive once. Now it didn't matter. Her face was gray, her hair short. Her suit was the same as the man's on Marquis' left.

The man was No. 4901. His face was gray, his hair dark, about the same size and build as Marquis. His fingers shook.

""Hello,"" Marquis said. The man shivered, then opened dull eyes. ""I just got in. Name's Charles Marquis.""

The man blinked. ""I'm—I'm—No. 4901."" He looked down at his chest, repeated the number.

Marquis asked, ""What's this indoctrination?""

""You learn. The bells ring—you forget—and learn—""

""There's no chance of escaping?"" Marquis whispered.

""Only by dying,"" 4901 shivered. He turned over and buried his face in his arms.

---

The screening hadn't found the poison capsule in Marquis' tooth. It was his ace in the hole, and he waited for the right time.

Bells rang. The prisoners jumped up and did exercises. More bells, and food trays appeared. Different bells, and they marched off to work.

You slept eight hours. Exercises five minutes. Eating ten minutes. Relaxation ten minutes. Work period eight hours. Repeat. That was life, and soon a man wouldn't know time or his name.

Marquis felt pain as he resisted the bells. The pain stopped only when he followed the bells.

He sat on his bed, eating while the bells rang. He watched the girl and the man, 4901. Why hadn't they tried to die?

No. 4901 tried to talk, remembering things from Earth. But only soft memories.

Marquis said, ""I don't think there's a prisoner here who doesn't want to escape, and death is our only way out.""

For a moment, No. 4901 stopped eating. Then continued as the bells urged. Pain needles hit Marquis, and he ate too. ""A man's life is his own,"" Marquis said. ""He has a right to take it to keep his integrity.""

No. 4901 groaned, mumbled ""Don't—don't—"" and curled on the floor.

The eating period ended. The lights went out. Bells for relaxation, then sleep bells.

Marquis lay in the dark, afraid. He had the poison and the will. But why hadn't the others acted? Maybe they were broken too soon. He could act. Tomorrow, he would take the poison. It would work slowly, painlessly, and he would be dead by the next sleep period.

He mentioned suicide to the girl during work. She moaned and curled up. After an hour, she returned to the machine. She avoided him.

Marquis went to a corner, took the poison, and returned to the machine. He felt triumphant.

Back on his bed, he drifted into what he knew was his final sleep. He would be dead soon.

---

Somewhere, someone was screaming.

A body in pain, twisting in steam, nerves twitching. A body floating, crying. Agony sweeping and returning in waves.

Someone alive who should be dead.

In the dark, Marquis moved a little. The screaming voice was his own.

He slowly wet his lips. _I'm alive!_

He struggled up from the bed, barely able to stand. Every muscle quivered. He longed to escape into endless sleep. But he was still alive. They had saved him.

Sweat poured from him. He tried to remember more. Pain. He lay down again, writhing on the bed as his mind built fantasies from broken memories.

The routine of the bells went on. Bells, leap up. Bells, exercises. Bells, eat. Bells, march. Bells, work. He tried to shut out the bells. He tried to talk to 4901. They avoided him.

But there were other ways. The poison was still hidden. He counted steps to the air-lock.

After the bells stopped and it was dark, he got up. He counted steps to the air-lock. No guards, no alarms. They relied on the conditioners. This time he would do it.

He stopped at the glasite dome, reflecting the Moon's surface. It was night out there.

He hesitated, feeling the cold airlessness waiting.

He turned the wheel. The door opened. He entered the air-lock and shut the first door. He turned the other wheel, and the outer door opened. Air rushed out, spinning him into the cold and silence.

He sank into the pumice dust, feeling no pain. The cold dissolved into dark pleasantness. This time he was dead, and they couldn't find him. Even if they did, what could they do?

Some part of him remained to observe and celebrate his victory. This time he was dead to stay.

---

This time he knew the twisting body in the pain was Charles Marquis.

Maybe a dream, he thought. So much pain isn't real. In a moment between life and death, one could dream of so much.

Yet he found himself anticipating defeat.

---

He opened his eyes slowly. It was dark, the same darkness. He was on the same bed. The familiar dark and silence were heavier than sound.

Everything whirled up and crashed down. He lay on the floor, his face cooled by the metal.

Some undetermined time had passed. He was alive. His body was stiff. He ached. There was a drumming in his head. He felt an icy horror.

He fell back onto the bed, trying to figure out how he could be alive.

He finally slept from sheer exhaustion. The bells woke him. The bells started him off again. He tried to talk to 4901. They avoided him. But they weren't really alive anymore. How long could he keep some part of himself as Charles Marquis?

He began a private routine. Dying, then finding he wasn't dead.

He tried many ways. Took more poison. But he was always alive again.

""You—4901! Talk to me! You know what's been happening to me?""

The man nodded over his food.

""This indoctrination—you, the girl—you went crazy when I talked about dying—what—?""

The man yelled, ""Don't... don't say it! All this—it's part of indoctrination. You're no different than us! We've all had it! All of us. Some more than others. You'll have to give in. I wish you could win. But you're no smarter than us. _You'll have to give in!_""

It was 4901's longest speech. Maybe I can get somewhere with him, Marquis thought. But 4901 wouldn't say more. Marquis kept trying. No one could understand what it meant to keep trying to die when no one would let you, when you kept waking up.

He tried the poison again. The big stamping machine crushed him, but he woke up whole. He grabbed a power cable, felt victory in flame. He slashed his wrists before sleep.

When he woke, he was whole. No scar.

He starved himself, resisting the eating bells, and knew he died from starvation.

_But I can't stay dead!_

""_... You'll have to give in!_""

---

He didn't know when it was. He had no idea how long he'd been there. But a guard appeared, guiding Marquis back to the office where the Manager waited.

The Manager said, ""You're the most remarkable prisoner we've had. There won't be another like you.""

Marquis whispered, ""Why?""

""You've tried to—you know. You've tried it more times than anyone here! We didn't think anyone had the stuff to try that many times.""

The Manager studied Marquis. ""Soon you'll be indoctrinated. You'll work to the bells, thinking little, except to keep your brain active. Or while the New System lasts. And I imagine that will be forever.""

""Forever....""

""Yes, yes. You're immortal now,"" the Manager smiled. ""Surely you realize _that_!""

_Immortal. I might have guessed. We live in a hell worse than death, and you, the Managers, live in paradise. We are immortal._

""You're immortal as long as we want. You'll never grow older than we want, never so weak as to hurt efficiency. That's what you were interested in on Earth, wasn't it? The mystery of the Managerials? Why we never seem to age. Why we have all the advantage.""

""Yes,"" Marquis whispered.

The Manager lit a paraette and explained.

""Political prisoners want to die. It challenged our order. We have no objection to your death. Even the will to die can be conditioned out of the most determined rebel. As it has been with you. You try enough times, and you die, but the pain of resurrection is so great that it's impossible to try again.""

Marquis couldn't speak. The mention of self-destruction rasped along his spine. ""No...."" he whispered. ""No—please—no—""

The Manager said, ""We won't mention it anymore. You'll never try it again.""

The light lanced into his eyes. His face had drawn back, cheekbones standing out, nose beak-like. Eyes bright painful blue.

The Manager yawned. ""Each prisoner has an identification punch-plate of their unique field. That's our immortality. Human difference is in the electro-magnetic rates. We have plates for every prisoner. We have one of you. Any dead body we dissolve into cells, a mass of potential to be reformed into any human from a punch-plate. Your field reforms the cells into you. It could only be you. We can resurrect anyone of whom we have a plate.

""That is all, No. 5274. Now that you're indoctrinated, you'll work in the food-mart.""

---

For a long time, he followed the routines. In the food-mart, among the beds and machines.

He talked more with No. 4901. He stopped mentioning suicide. But if anyone thought he'd given up, they were wrong. The flame still burned inside him. He wouldn't let it go out. Now he had a plan.

During an eating period, Marquis said to 4901, ""You want to die. Wait—I'm talking about something we can discuss. A murder agreement. We aren't conditioned against killing each other. It's only an overt act of self-destruction. But we can plan a way to kill each other.""

4901 stopped eating. ""What's the use? We'll only come back.""

""I have a plan. They won't bring either of us back.""

That wasn't true. _One_ of them would come back. Marquis hoped 4901 wouldn't see through the plan. And it worked.

Marquis explained. 4901 listened and smiled. It was the first time Marquis saw a prisoner smile.

He left the poison capsule for 4901. During the next eating periods, 4901 would put it in Marquis' food. Marquis wouldn't know which meal. He had to eat. The bells conditioned him. And not eating was an overt act of self-destruction.

He wasn't conditioned against death by another.

After eating, 4901 whispered, ""You're poisoned. It was in one of the cans.""

""Great!"" Marquis almost shouted. ""I'll die by the next work period. That gives us time. I'll dispose of you.""

4901 went to his bed and the bells rang, and both slept.

---

4901 resisted enough to follow Marquis into the food-mart. As planned, 4901 stood behind the hydroponic beds.

Marquis worked at the machines, then went to 4901. ""Turn around.""

4901 smiled. ""Good luck,"" he said. ""Good luck—to you!""

Marquis hit him across the neck with a bar, killing him. He changed clothes with 4901. He put his clothes in the incinerator. He dragged the body to a food-grinding vat. The body disappeared, ground and mixed with food.

Within eight hours, 4901's cells would be in thousands of cans. Much of it would be consumed.

At the end of the work period, Marquis returned to his cell. He stopped at 4901's bed.

The sleep bells sounded and darkness came. This was the final dark. This time he had beaten the game. The poison would kill him. He wore 4901's clothes. He was on 4901's bed.

He would die—as 4901. The guards would find 4901 missing, but never find him. They would find 4901 dead, a suicide. They would put the body in the tank, dissolve it, and resurrect 4901.

Not only have I managed to die, Marquis thought, but I've managed the ultimate suicide. No trace of him anywhere. Even my cells will be resurrected as someone else. As 4901.

---

""And that's the way it was,"" No. 4901 would tell new prisoners. Sometimes they listened, but the interest died during indoctrination. But No. 4901's interest never died.

He knew he could never let himself die as a human, never let himself be controlled by the bells. He was nearly dead as an individual, but No. 5274 saved him. He could keep alive and hope by remembering 5274. He clung to that memory. As long as he remembered, he could keep burning.

Every night before the bells, he remembered 5274's words and gestures. He told the plan every night, and to everyone in indoctrination.

Swimming up through pain, he was mad at 5274 at first, but he realized the plan enabled one man to win.

""He will always be alive to me. Maybe part of me. Nobody knows. But his memory will live. He succeeded in an ultimate dying—no trace of him. But the memory of him will be alive when the New System is dead. That spirit will assure the Underground of victory. And meanwhile, I'll keep 5274 alive.

""He knew the psychology of the Managers. They can't afford an error. He knew they'd have one more plate than prisoners. But he knew they'd destroy the plate. They'd gain nothing resurrecting 5274. There would still be an extra plate.

""So they destroyed the plate. He knew. They went back through records, to Earth, through files, through birth records. And they destroyed every shred of evidence that No. 5274 ever existed.""

So he kept the memory alive, and that kept 4901 alive, while the others became automatons, sensing nothing but the bells.

But 4901 could remember something magnificent, and anticipate, and that was hope. He found no one believed him, but he kept telling the story.

""Maybe this number didn't exist,"" someone would say. ""If there's no record—""

4901 would smile. ""In my head, there's where the record is. _I_ know. _I_ remember.""

And so 4901 was the only one who could still smile when, sometime later—no one knew how long—the Underground was victorious, and the Managerial System crumbled.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story is the struggle between individual freedom and identity versus the oppressive control of an authoritarian regime, represented by the Managerial System. Charles Marquis, the protagonist, embodies the fight for personal autonomy and resistance against a dehumanizing system that seeks to strip individuals of their identity and will.

Marquis's repeated attempts at suicide and his ultimate plan to die in a way that would prevent resurrection highlight the extreme measures he is willing to take to preserve his sense of self and resist becoming an automaton within the system.

062.txt,"Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw moved from Manchester to London because Mr. Openshaw had a new job managing a warehouse for a big company. He was curious about London and thought the people there were just lazy and only cared about fashion. He was used to the simple life in Manchester, where people ate early dinners and had long evenings. Even though he pretended he didn’t like the change, he was secretly happy about moving because it came with a good salary increase. They chose a modest house to show that a Manchester man doesn’t care for show, but inside it was very comfortable and warm. Mr. Openshaw liked to keep big fires in the winter and was always hospitable to guests.

Mrs. Openshaw was a pretty, gentle woman. She was 35 years old, and he was 42. She had a daughter from her first husband, Frank Wilson, and a little boy named Edwin with Mr. Openshaw. Mr. Openshaw loved to speak to Edwin in a Lancashire dialect.

Alice, Mrs. Openshaw, was an orphan raised by her uncle and his wife in Liverpool. She married her cousin, Frank Wilson, when she was very young and shy. Frank was a sailor, and when he returned, he was very kind to her and fell in love with her. Her uncle didn’t mind their romance, but his wife was not supportive. Alice married Frank to escape her aunt’s tyranny. Frank and Alice had a child, but he died at sea before he could see his daughter. Mrs. Wilson, Frank’s stepmother, was not kind at first, but she softened after Frank’s death and allowed Alice to stay with her.

After losing Frank, Alice was lonely and worried as her daughter became sick with a spinal problem. Despite this, she was grateful for her sweet memories with Frank and for her child. Mrs. Wilson’s financial situation worsened, and Alice offered to stay together to help each other out. They moved to Manchester, where Alice managed a boarding house, and they took in lodgers. Alice was determined to support her daughter.

Mr. Openshaw became one of their lodgers. He admired Alice’s care for her daughter and soon fell in love with her. He proposed, offering to care for her and her child, and she accepted. They married, and Mr. Openshaw took care of Mrs. Wilson, making her financially independent.

They moved to London for Mr. Openshaw’s job, and shortly after, Mr. Openshaw invited his uncle and aunt Chadwick to visit. During their stay, Mrs. Chadwick lost a brooch, and suspicion fell on Norah, Alice’s former maid. Norah was innocent and had been loyal to Alice. Eventually, the brooch was found, and the Openshaws realized their mistake.

One day, a man from Alice’s past appeared. It was Frank Wilson, who was thought to be dead. He had been shipwrecked and stranded for years. Norah found him and told him Alice had remarried. Heartbroken, he left. Mr. Openshaw discovered the truth but decided to keep it a secret to protect Alice and their family. He arranged for Frank to be buried quietly.

The Openshaws continued their lives, and Mr. Openshaw cared deeply for Alice and her children. He respected and loved Alice, helping her raise her child and leading a happy life together.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the unexpected return of Frank Wilson, Alice's first husband, who was presumed dead. This situation presents a moral and emotional dilemma for both Alice Openshaw and her current husband, Mr. Openshaw.

For Alice, the conflict stems from the shocking revelation that her first husband, whom she believed to be dead, is actually alive. This challenges her current marriage and her sense of loyalty and love. She must grapple with her past feelings for Frank and her commitment to Mr. Openshaw, who has been a supportive and loving husband.

For Mr. Openshaw, the dilemma is whether to reveal the truth about Frank's return to Alice or to protect her and their family by keeping it a secret. His decision to keep the situation hidden and ensure Frank is buried quietly shows his deep care for Alice's emotional well-being and the stability of their family life.

This conflict highlights themes of love, loyalty, and the complexities of human relationships, as both Alice and Mr. Openshaw navigate the impact of past relationships on their present lives. Ultimately, the resolution of this conflict lies in Mr. Openshaw's decision to prioritize the happiness and unity of his family over the potential disruption that the truth could cause.","Your first husband returns from the dead, and your current spouse knows.

063.txt,"Wives always try to cure husbands of bad habits, even on lonely asteroids!

You have to understand that Palmer really loved his wife. That's why he came up with his simple little plan. It was all for her own good, as he kept telling himself. He didn't think of himself as a murderer.

She was sitting by the fake fireplace, reading peacefully as if she were back home on Mars, not on this lonely space station. She had gotten used to the loneliness and strangeness of this life--the lack of friends, the need to save air, the weird feeling of artificial gravity that changed a bit whenever there were impurities in the station fuel. She adjusted to everything except her husband.

She seemed to feel his eyes on her and looked up with a smile. ""Feeling okay, dear?"" she asked.

""Of course. How about you?""

""As well as can be expected.""

""Not very good, then.""

She didn't answer, and he thought, ""She hates to admit it, but she envies me. Well, I'll fix that.""

He stared out the thick, transparent window at the stars, which shone brightly without any dust or atmosphere to block their light.

People said that living on asteroids was terrible, but that wasn't true for him. Life here had been amazing, really satisfying. And soon, it would be the same for his wife.

He would have denied it if you had said he found her annoying. But to certain addicts, sober people are a bother, and Palmer was more than just an addict. He was addicted to marak, and in the eyes of marak addicts, everything and everyone was wonderful, except for those who didn't share their love of the drug. Those people were seen as miserable and almost less than human.

Of course, most addicts wouldn't say it like that. Palmer certainly wouldn't. He thought of his wife as someone he loved very much, someone he needed to make happy. That her happiness would also speed up her death was just bad luck. She was going to die soon anyway, so why not let her live her last days in the peace and happiness that marak could bring?

Louise would have had an answer to that if he had asked her. But he was careful never to ask.

She put her book down and looked at him again. She said, ""Jim, darling, do you think you could fix the TV?""

""Not without a mesotron rectifier.""

""Even the radio would be nice.""

""It wouldn't help. There's too much static from both Mars and Earth right now.""

That's what was great about marak, he thought. It changed how he felt, kept him calm and in control, able to handle any problem. He didn't miss the radio or TV, and he never touched the library of books. He didn't need them.

A shadow passed by outside the window, blocking the stars for a moment. It was the shadow of death, and he could still smile at it. Even death seemed wonderful. When it finally came, it would find him happy. He wouldn't be scared of it like Louise was when she saw the shadow.

He smiled at his wife, remembering the six years they had been married. It was a short time, but a wonderful one. They had only one major fight, in the second year, and after that, they got along perfectly. Then, two years ago, he had started taking marak, and after that, he couldn't have argued with anyone. It was an amazing drug, and it was a mystery to him why anyone would object to it.

Louise had tried to talk him out of it when she found out, but he turned every argument into a peaceful discussion, full of good humor on his side. He even stayed good-humored when she tried to slip the antidote into his food. It was his attitude that left her baffled and angry, and he found that funny too. Imagine a wife getting mad because her husband was too nice!

But she was never going to get mad again. He would make sure of that. Not after tonight. A big change was going to happen in her life.

She picked up another book, and he pitied her. He knew she wasn't interested in books. She was just restless, looking for something to do, trying to pass the time before the shadows outside ended it for her. She couldn't understand why he was so peaceful and content, doing nothing.

She threw the book down and said angrily, ""You're such a fool, Jim! You sit there, happy and sure of yourself, your mind blank, just waiting for them to kill you and me. And you even seem happy when I mention it.""

""I'm happy about everything, dear.""

""Even about dying?""

""Living or dying--it doesn't matter. Whatever happens, I can't be unhappy.""

""If it weren't for the drug, we'd both live. You'd think of a way to kill them before they kill us.""

""There is no way.""

""There must be. You just can't think of it while the drug has you in its grip.""

""The drug doesn't have you, dear."" He asked without sarcasm, ""Why don't you think of a way?""

""Because I don't have your training. I don't understand the science, and all the equipment means nothing to me.""

""There's nothing to be done.""

Her fists clenched. ""If you weren't under the influence of the drug--""

""You know it doesn't affect thinking. Tests have shown that.""

""Tests done by addicts themselves!""

""The fact that they can conduct tests should prove there's nothing wrong with their minds.""

""But there is!"" she shouted. ""I see it in you. Oh, I know you can still do math and find words that mean the same thing, but that's not real thinking. Real thinking means solving real problems--hard problems that you can't handle just with paper and pencil. It means wanting to use your brain for a long time. And that's what the drug has ruined. It's taken away your motivation.""

""I still do my duties.""

""Not as well as you used to, and only because they've become a habit. Just like talking to me is a habit. If you'd let me give you the antidote--""

He chuckled at her suggestion. Once an addict was cured, they couldn't get addicted again. The antidote made them immune to the drug. That's why addicts fought so hard against being cured. And she thought she could convince him by arguing!

He said, ""You talk about not being able to think!""

""I know,"" she replied angrily. ""I'm the fool, for arguing with you when I know it's impossible to convince a marak addict.""

""That's it,"" he nodded, and chuckled again. But that wasn't quite it. For he was also chuckling at his plan. She thought he couldn't tackle a real problem. Well, he would tackle one tonight. Then she would adopt his point of view and wouldn't be unhappy anymore. She would wonder how she could ever have opposed him.

He fell into a doze and hardly noticed her glaring at him. When he came out of it, it was to hear her say, ""We have to stay alive as long as possible. For the sake of the lighthouse.""

""Of course, my dear. I agree.""

""And the longer we stay alive, the more chance there is that a ship will pick us up.""

""Oh, no, there's no chance at all,"" he said cheerfully. ""You know that as well as I do. No use deceiving yourself, my love.""

Non-addicts couldn't face facts, he thought. They had to cling to blind optimism with no justification.

He knew there was no hope. He could calmly look at the facts, see the inevitability of their dying--and take pleasure even in that.

He reviewed them for her now. ""Let's see, sweetheart, if I've lost my ability to analyze a situation. We're here with our little lighthouse in the middle of some asteroids between Mars and Earth. Ships have been wrecked here, and our job is to prevent more wrecks. The lighthouse sends out a beam that helps astrogators know where they are. Usually, there's nothing for us to do. But when the beam fails--""

""That will be the end.""

""On those occasions,"" he continued, ignoring her, ""I'm supposed to leave our nice little shelter and make repairs quickly. Usually, lighthousekeeping is boring. It can drive people insane. That's why it's given to happily married couples like us, who are used to living quietly.""

""And that's why even happily married couples are usually relieved after one year,"" she added bitterly.

""But, darling,"" he said cheerfully, ""you mustn't blame anyone. Who expected a rogue meteor to hit us and knock us out of orbit? And who expected it to pick up a bunch of--those?""

He gestured toward the window, where a shadow paused. By the light that shone through, he could see the creature looked relatively harmless. It had what seemed like a round, funny face, but it wasn't a face at all. It had no eyes, nose, or mouth. The effect of features came from the odd blend of colors. Almost escaping notice were the stomach fangs, which could extend and retract like a snake's.

He saw Louise shudder and said, ""Interesting, aren't they? They're rock breathers, you know. They need very little oxygen, and they get it from the rocks.""

""Don't talk about them.""

""Okay, if you don't want me to. But about us--you see, my dear, no one expected us to be lost. And even if the Lighthouse Service has started looking, it'll take a long time to find us.""

""We have food, water, air. If not for those creatures, we'd last until a rescue ship appeared.""

""But even a rescue ship wouldn't reach us unless we kept the beam going. So far, we've been lucky. It's worked well. But sooner or later it'll break, and I'll have to go out and fix it. You agree, don't you, Louise, dear?""

She nodded. ""The beam must be kept in order.""

""That's when the creatures will get me,"" he said, almost satisfied. ""I may kill one or two, though I hate to kill anything. But you know there are more than a dozen, and it's hard to shoot in a spacesuit at such fast creatures.""

""And if you don't succeed, if they get you--"" She broke down and cried.

He looked at her with compassion, and smoothed her hair. Yet, under the drug's influence, he enjoyed even her crying. It was a wonderful drug. Under its spell, a person could really enjoy life.

Tonight she would begin to enjoy life with him.

Their chronometer worked perfectly, and they still followed Earth time. At seven in the evening, they had a nice meal. Knowing they might die tomorrow, Louise decided they would eat and drink well tonight, and she chose a special meal. She just had to pull a lever, and the food slid into the oven, cooked by a beam of radiation. Jim picked the wine and brandy--marak didn't affect the enjoyment of alcohol, and one of the sights of the Solar System was a drunk addict.

But marak itself often cured alcoholism. Once an alcoholic experienced its effect, he didn't need to get drunk to forget his troubles. He enjoyed his troubles instead, and drank for the taste, not to escape an unhappy world.

So tonight Palmer drank just enough to feel stimulated. He did what he should have done long ago. Unnoticed, he put a tablet of marak in his wine and one in Louise's. The slight bitterness would hardly be noticed. And then Louise would be an addict too.

That's how marak worked. The craving wasn't mysterious. Once you experienced its delight, you wouldn't do without it.

The tablet he took that morning was wearing off, but he was so pleased with what he was doing that he didn't mind. For the next half hour, he would enjoy himself by looking at Louise, thinking that finally, they would be united, no longer separated by her silly ideas about saving themselves. And then the drug would take effect, and they would feel like they were among the stars together, until the beam failed and they went out together to fix it, and the shadows closed in on them.

He had made sure Louise had her back to him when he dropped the tablet into her glass, and she suspected nothing. She drank her wine without commenting on the taste. He felt a sudden urge to kiss her, and, to her surprise, he did. Then he sat down and continued with dinner.

He waited.

An hour later, he knew he had made her happy. She was laughing like she hadn't in a long time. She laughed at his jokes, at the way he raised his glass to her, even at what she saw through the window. Sometimes it seemed she was laughing at nothing at all.

He tried to remember how he felt the first time he took the drug. He hadn't been quite so cheerful, not so hysterical. But then, the drug didn't affect everyone the same way. She wasn't as balanced as he had been. The important thing was she was happy.

Curiously, he wasn't happy at all.

It took about five seconds for him to understand why. He sprang to his feet, knocking over the table. He saw she wasn't surprised, that she still watched him with satisfaction.

""You've cured me!"" he cried. ""You gave me the antidote!""

And he began to curse. He remembered the other time she tried, when he had been alert and noticed the strange metallic taste. He spat it out and laughed at her.

Now he couldn't laugh. He had been so focused on giving her the tablet that he forgot to protect himself, and he was caught. He was normal now--her idea of normal--and he would never again feel the drug's wonderful effect. He realized his situation on this lonely asteroid. He glanced at the window and what was waiting outside, and it was his turn to shudder.

He noticed she was still smiling.

He said bitterly, ""You're the addict now, and I'm cured.""

She stopped smiling and said quietly, ""Jim, listen. You're wrong, completely wrong. I didn't give you the antidote, and you didn't give me the drug.""

""I put it in your wineglass myself.""

She shook her head. ""That was a tablet I swapped for yours. It's an anti-virus dose from our medicine chest. You took the same thing. That's why you feel so down. You're not under the drug's influence anymore.""

He took a deep breath. ""But I'm not cured?""

""No. I knew I couldn't slip you the antidote. The taste is too strong. Later you'll be able to start taking the drug again. That is, if you want to, after experiencing what it's like to be normal. But not now. You have to keep your head clear. You have to think of something to save us.""

""But there's nothing to think of!"" he shouted angrily. ""I told you the drug doesn't affect intelligence!""

""I still don't believe you. If you'd only try, use your mind--""

He said savagely, ""I'm not going to bother. Give me those marak tablets.""

She backed away. ""I thought you might want them. I took no chances. I threw them out.""

""Out there?"" A horrified and incredulous look was on his face. ""You mean I'm stuck here without them? Louise, you fool, there's no help for us! The other way, at least, we'd have died happy. But now--""

He stared out the window. The shadows were there in full force. Not one, but two, three--he counted six. It was as if they knew the end had come.

They had reason to be happy, he thought with despair. And perhaps--he shrank from the thought, but it forced itself into his mind--perhaps, now that all happiness had gone, he might as well end everything. There would be no days spent torturing himself anticipating a horrible death.

Louise exclaimed suddenly, ""Jim, look! They're frolicking!""

He looked. The creatures certainly seemed happy. One leaped from the airless surface of the asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He had never seen them do that before. Usually, they clung to the rocky surface. Another was spinning around oddly, as if it had lost its sense of balance.

Louise said, ""They've swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred doses--enough to drug every creature on the asteroid!""

For a moment Palmer stared at the alien drug addicts. Then he put on his spacesuit, took his gun, and, without any danger to himself, went out and shot them one by one. He noted, with a kind of grim envy, that they died happy.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the differing perspectives and actions of Palmer and his wife, Louise, regarding the use of the drug marak and their survival on a lonely asteroid. Palmer is addicted to marak, which keeps him in a state of blissful ignorance, while Louise, sober and desperate, seeks to save them from an inevitable death by trying to cure him of his addiction. This conflict is further complicated by the presence of alien creatures outside their space station, posing a deadly threat to their lives.

Palmer's addiction to marak represents his escape from reality and responsibility, as he believes that being happy under the influence of the drug is preferable, even in the face of impending doom. Louise, on the other hand, is frustrated by Palmer's lack of motivation to find a solution to their predicament and believes that his addiction is impairing his ability to think critically and act to save them.

The climax of the conflict occurs when Louise cunningly swaps Palmer's drug tablet with an anti-virus dose, temporarily freeing him from the drug's influence. This forces Palmer to confront their dire situation with a clear mind, ultimately leading to a resolution where he is able to eliminate the alien threat after they accidentally ingest the marak tablets and become incapacitated.

The story explores themes of addiction, perception of reality, and the lengths to which individuals might go to either escape from or confront their circumstances.","Would you risk everything to cure your loved one’s addiction, even if it means facing terrifying alien creatures on an asteroid?","If you could make your partner truly happy but speed up their death, would you do it?","You're surrounded by alien threats, but your biggest problem is your partner’s addiction.

064.txt,"Karl Allen was out of breath, pulling hard on a rope tied to a raft of parampa logs floating in the river. ""The beasts aren't much help, are they?"" he asked.

""No,"" Joseph Hill replied, panting as he coiled some of the rope around his waist. ""They always stop working when they see it's going to be tough.""

The two men stood knee-deep in mud on the riverbank, pulling on the rope. A few yards away, their small yllumphs, animal helpers, were munching grass and watching without helping.

""If we're late for the ship's landing, Joe, we'll be taken off the list,"" Karl said.

Hill, catching his breath, looked worried. ""Yeah, I've been thinking about that,"" he admitted.

They pulled the raft onto the muddy bank, though one end still stuck out into the rushing river. Karl checked the shadows on the ground to see how much time they had left. ""Still got about two hours before the rocket lands in Landing City,"" he said, trying to reassure Hill.

The men began to saddle up their yllumphs for the trip. Karl tied some furs onto his saddle. Hill asked, ""What are you taking furs for? It's not the trading rocket.""

Karl replied, ""I thought it might be cold tonight on the way back, and maybe she'll appreciate the furs.""

""You didn't think of that yourself,"" Hill grunted. ""Grundy must have told you to. Spoil them, and they'll expect you to do all the work.""

""You didn't have to sign up,"" Karl pointed out. ""You could have asked for a wife from another planet.""

Hill shrugged. ""One's probably as good as another. They'll have to work the farms and raise families.""

Karl laughed, and they rode into the forest, imagining what it would be like with someone new to talk to, someone to help out with chores. He was in his mid-twenties and wanted a wife and kids. ""You going to have a lot of kids, Joe?"" he asked.

Hill, startled out of his thoughts, nodded. ""Yeah, need help at the sawmill someday. Can't do it all myself.""

As they left the forest and reached the grassy lands, they could see Landing City in the distance, a rusty collection of shacks and muddy streets with a small rocket port.

""What's so special about Earth women, Joe?"" Karl asked as they rode.

Hill scratched his head. ""I don't know, Karl. They're supposed to be sophisticated or something.""

When they reached the rocket port, a crowd was gathered around a poster of a beautiful woman from Earth. She was smiling and blowing a kiss, with a message that said, ""I'm from Earth!""

A loudspeaker called them to get their numbers for the wife draft. Karl picked number 53. He wondered what the woman with the same number on the rocket would be like. They would pair up by numbers, with no time to get to know each other.

""Sandwich, mister? Pop?"" a boy offered as Karl waited for the rocket to arrive.

Karl flipped him a coin and grabbed some food. He stood with Hill, straining to see the rocket coming down from the sky.

**Chapter 2**

Claude Escher, head of the Colonization Board, knew there was a problem. More men were leaving Earth to colonize other planets than women, creating a big imbalance. Women were left behind, and the competition to find a husband was fierce.

MacDonald, Escher's boss, explained, ""It's not just about finding a husband. It's affecting society. There are more crimes and silly laws because of all the women who couldn't find husbands and became old maids.""

Escher asked, ""So how do we convince women to colonize?""

MacDonald said, ""We have to make them want to, or make it so they have no choice.""

Escher thought about it. They needed to change the qualifications for colonizing, make it easier for women to go. They needed to convince them it was worthwhile or force them into it.

It wasn't going to be easy, but they had to find a solution soon.

**Chapter 3**

Phyllis Hanson finished up her workday and went home to her small apartment. She didn't consider herself beautiful, but she wanted to find a husband. At thirty, she spent most nights waiting for the phone to ring, but it never did.

She looked at a poster that had come in the mail. It showed a handsome man standing over a city with farms and forests. The poster invited women to come to the colonies, promising romance and adventure.

Phyllis knew it was a privacy violation to send such things, but she couldn't help being tempted by the idea of leaving Earth for a new life.

**Chapter 4**

Ruby Johnson was caught shoplifting a beautiful dress she couldn't afford. The judge gave her a choice: ten years in prison and a big fine, or go to the colony planets with a $500 bonus.

Ruby knew it wasn't really a choice. She'd have to go to the colonies.

**Chapter 5**

Suzanne Carstens was living comfortably in her apartment when she was suddenly rounded up by the Colonization Board. She was given the same choice as Ruby: jail and a fine or emigrate to the colonies.

She realized she had no choice but to agree to go.

**Chapter 6**

In the transfer shed, Phyllis and other women waited to be assigned to different colony planets. They were given information about each planet, and Phyllis chose Midplanet, which had a temperate climate and opportunities for farming and fur trapping.

**Chapter 7**

Escher and MacDonald were playing golf in Escher's office. MacDonald congratulated Escher on the increase in women emigrants, but he was worried about the methods they used.

Escher explained, ""We had to think outside the box. We sent the women who weren't wanted on Earth. They won't have a chance to compare themselves to women from other planets.""

MacDonald was still uneasy, but Escher was confident. The women would be appreciated in the colonies, and the colonists would think they were getting something special.

**Chapter 8**

As Phyllis and the other women landed on Midplanet, she felt a mix of disappointment and hope. The modern city she expected was a collection of shacks, but she was determined to make it better.

She was also curious about the colonists. They looked rough and uncultured, but they seemed healthy and strong. She was excited to start a new life.

**Chapter 9**

Karl watched as the rocket landed and the women descended. He was amazed at how beautiful they were. He couldn't wait to meet the woman with the same number as his.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around gender imbalance and societal expectations on both Earth and the colony planets. On Earth, there is a significant disparity between the number of men and women seeking to colonize new planets, leading to societal issues such as increased crime and restrictive laws for women who are unable to find husbands. The Colonization Board, led by Claude Escher and pressured by MacDonald, faces the dilemma of how to encourage or force more women to emigrate to the colonies to balance this disparity.

On the colony planets, the conflict manifests in the lives of male colonists like Karl and Hill, who are eager for companionship and domestic help, and the women from Earth, such as Phyllis, Ruby, and Suzanne, who are compelled to join the colonies due to societal pressures or as alternatives to harsher penalties like imprisonment. The story explores themes of choice versus coercion, the commodification of relationships, and the contrasting desires for adventure and companionship against the backdrop of colonization. The resolution of this conflict hinges on how these characters navigate their new lives and relationships in the colonies while grappling with the expectations placed upon them.","What if your only chance to find love was on a faraway colony, but you had no say in who you'd marry?","How would you handle it if you were picked for a ""wife draft,"" knowing you might never see your home again?",Would you move to a new planet if it meant avoiding jail time but leaving everything behind?,science fiction,comedy,love,What are Karl and Joseph doing at the beginning of the story?,"Karl and Joseph are pulling a raft of logs onto the riverbank, trying to get it out of the water.",Why are Karl and Joseph worried about being late?,"They are worried about being late because if they miss the ship's landing, they will be taken off the list for the wife draft.",What might happen if the Colonization Board doesn't find a solution to the imbalance of men and women?,"If the Colonization Board doesn't find a solution, the imbalance could lead to more societal issues on Earth, such as increased crime and dissatisfaction among women who can't find husbands.",How does the Colonization Board convince women to emigrate to the colonies?,"The Colonization Board uses a combination of persuasion and coercion.

065.txt,"The United States Submarine _Ambitious Brill_ smoothly moved into its spot at the Brooklyn Navy Yard after being at sea for too long, according to the crew. After going through all the needed steps, most of the happy crew went ashore to enjoy a well-deserved break in the busy streets of New York City.

The trip had been calm, with nothing really dangerous or exciting happening. Well, except there was more high-ranking officers aboard than usual, and the whole trip was done underwater, except for one time when they came up to check their position. Everything looked fine.

That doesn't mean the crew was totally satisfied. They had questions they couldn't ask and didn't talk about even when they got ashore. They knew that while nuclear-powered subs could travel around the world without surfacing, this was rare for a supposedly Diesel-electric sub like the _Ambitious Brill_. And those who saw what happened in the battery room were the most puzzled. They knew some of the battery cells had been taken out to make room for a steel box, and the rest of the battery hadn't been used at all.

With no one but the duty watch aboard, and no one in the battery room, Captain Dean Lacey felt free to say, ""What a battery!""

The ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Newton Wayne, looked at the Pentagon representative. ""Yes, sir, it is."" His voice sounded like he was trying to catch up with what was happening. ""This puts us ahead of the Russians.""

Captain Lacey agreed. ""How right you are, commander. We can convert every ship in the Navy in a tenth of the time we thought.""

They both looked at a civilian, who nodded. ""And at a tenth of the cost, gentlemen,"" he said. ""North American Carbide & Metals can make these units cheaply, and fast enough to convert every ship in the Navy within a year.""

Captain Lacey glanced at Wayne. ""This is Top Secret, you understand.""

""Yes, sir; I understand,"" Wayne said.

""Very well."" He looked back at the civilian. ""Are we ready, Mr. Thorn?""

""Anytime you are, captain,"" the civilian said.

""Fine. You have your instructions, commander. Carry on.""

""Aye, aye, sir,"" Wayne said.

Less than an hour later, Captain Lacey and Mr. Thorn were having dinner at a very exclusive club in New York. Most clubs in New York are called ""exclusive"" because they exclude people who don't meet their standards of wealth. But this club was for military, naval officers, and certain government civilians. These men were dedicated professionals, and their lives were open books to each other.

Captain Lacey was a member. Mr. Richard Thorn was a guest, one of the few who qualified to be invited. Here, they could talk openly.

After their meal, and over some rare brandy, Captain Lacey asked the question that had been bothering him. ""Thorn, three months ago that battery didn't exist. Who was the genius who invented it?""

Thorn smiled. ""Genius is the word. Now that the contracts with the Navy are signed, I can tell you. But you're wrong; it did exist. We just didn't know about it.""

Lacey raised an eyebrow. ""Oh? How did it come to the attention of North American Carbide & Metals?""

Thorn thought for a moment before speaking. ""The first I heard about it was four months ago. Seems longer. I was asked to witness a demonstration out on Salt Lake Flats.""

Out on the Salt Lake Flats, where there was no chance of tricks, Richard Thorn, a Ph.D. who preferred to be called ""Mister,"" was in a bad mood. He had flown to Salt Lake City on short notice and was taken out to the blinding white Salt Flats. It was hot, which Thorn didn't like, but he couldn't complain too much since he arranged the test himself. The business office was in a hurry to get it done, and Thorn wished they could have waited for cooler weather. At least it was dry heat, and he made sure to bring plenty of water.

The vehicles arrived at the spot in the middle of nowhere and stopped in a circle. Thorn got out and saw the man named Sorensen get out of another jeep.

Sorensen looked like an Angry Old Man, although he wasn't that old, maybe around fifty. He had a scowl that seemed carved by years of frustration, and his voice had an acid edge. But sometimes Thorn thought he saw a flash of humor in Sorensen's eyes. He was lean, tall, with white hair that still showed some blonde, and he had a Minnesota accent.

Sorensen carried the Black Suitcase. Thorn had seen it before and thought of it as ""the Black Suitcase,"" giving it capital letters in his mind after some preliminary tests. But Thorn wasn't easily fooled. Too many men had been tricked before, and Thorn didn't want to be another fool.

He walked over to Sorensen, who was handling the heavy suitcase. ""Need any help?"" Thorn asked, knowing the answer.

""Nope,"" Sorensen said. ""I can handle it.""

The suitcase wasn't really black; it was a dark brown, made darker by use, but Thorn thought of it as the Black Suitcase, like the proverbial Little Black Box that Did Things. In testing, a Little Black Box is a symbol for a mystery component in a circuit. The question asks what could be inside to create the effect. Sorensen's Black Suitcase was a mystery to Thorn; he couldn't figure it out.

""Hotter'n Billy Blue Blazes!"" Sorensen said, putting the suitcase down. He grinned, losing his Angry Old Man look for a moment. ""You ready to go, Mr. Thorn?""

""I'm ready anytime you are,"" Thorn said grumpily.

Sorensen chuckled, which surprised Thorn. ""You know the difference between you and me, Mr. Thorn? You think this test is probably a waste of time. Me, I know it is.""

""Let's get on with it,"" Thorn said.

It took two hours to set up the equipment, even though some circuits were prefabricated. Thorn wanted to ensure all data was correct and recorded. Sorensen just watched. He had brought the Black Suitcase and would only be allowed to turn it on.

Before the technicians started, Sorensen warned them not to open the suitcase, or they might get blown sky high, and he didn't want anyone getting funny with him. Thorn was sure Sorensen had a gun in his pocket.

Thorn sighed. ""Don't worry, Mr. Sorensen. We don't have any plans to steal your invention."" The technicians had already been warned not to touch the suitcase. Thorn just hoped Sorensen's bomb, or whatever it was, was well-made.

When everything was ready, Sorensen turned on his suitcase. ""O.K.,"" he said.

A technician flipped other switches, and a bank of light bulbs came on, four at a time. Eventually, all 100 bulbs, each 100 watts, were lit, though the Utah sun made them look dim. The technicians checked their instruments and confirmed that about 10 kilowatts of power was coming from the suitcase.

Sorensen and Thorn sat in a tent, watching the lights shine.

One technician came in, wiping his forehead. ""Well, there she goes. Mr. Sorensen, if that thing is dangerous, shouldn't we back off?""

""It isn't dangerous,"" Sorensen said. ""Nothing's going to happen.""

The technician looked unhappy. ""Then I don't see why we couldn't have tested it in the shop. Would've been easier and more comfortable.""

Thorn smoked silently.

Sorensen nodded. ""Yes, Mr. Siegel, it would've been.""

Siegel sat down and lit a cigarette. ""Mr. Sorensen, have you got a patent on that battery?""

The humor returned to Sorensen's eyes. ""Nope. I didn't patent the battery in that suitcase.""

""How come?"" Siegel asked. ""Nobody could steal it if you patented it.""

""Couldn't they?"" Sorensen asked. ""Do you know anything about batteries, Mr. Siegel?""

""A little. I'm not an expert. I'm an electrician. But I know a bit.""

Sorensen nodded. ""Then you should know battery-making is an art, not science. If you did everything by the book, some batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than an hour, while others could last a year. What you get depends on many things.""

""I've heard that,"" Siegel said.

Thorn smoked in silence. He'd heard Sorensen's arguments before. Sorensen didn't mind discussing his battery in theory but wouldn't talk specifics. But Thorn couldn't blame him. Sorensen was right about battery-making. If he had something new, he was smart not to patent it.

""Now,"" Sorensen continued, ""let's suppose my battery is made of lead and lead dioxide plates in sulfuric acid with a few tweaks. I'm not saying it is, just suppose.""

""O.K., suppose,"" said Siegel. ""Couldn't you patent it?""

""What's to patent? The lead-acid cell is old. Can't patent that. Copper oxide as a depolarizer? Old hat. Laminated plates? No patent there.""

Siegel looked at the glowing bulbs. ""You mean you can't patent it, even if it works a hundred times better than an ordinary battery?""

""Hell, man,"" Sorensen said, ""you can't patent performance! You need something concrete. Oh, a top-notch attorney might get me a patent, but I wouldn't trust it to hold up in court.""

""And even with a strong patent, what good would it do? Ever hear of a patent pool?""

""No,"" Siegel said. ""What's a patent pool?""

""I'll give you an example. If all manufacturers of a product agree to a patent pool, one company's patent can be used by all. Say the auto companies do this. If you invent a radical engine, they'll offer you a pittance. Why offer more? Where else can you sell it? If one company gets it, they all do. No competition. If you refuse to sell, they wait until the patent expires and use it for free.""

""North American Carbide & Metals,"" said Thorn quietly, ""is not in any patent pool, Mr. Sorensen.""

""I know,"" Sorensen said. ""Battery patents are tricky. That's why I'm doing this my way. I'm not selling the gadget. I'm selling results. For a million dollars, I'll show your company how to build a device that produces power like the contract says. I guarantee the price I quote.""

He looked back at the bulbs burning.

""… They kept burning for ten hours,"" Thorn continued. ""Then he shut off his battery.""

Captain Lacey frowned. ""That's funny.""

""What is?"" Thorn asked, surprised by the interruption.

""What you've been telling me,"" Lacey said. ""I swear I've heard—"" He stopped and snapped his fingers. ""Sure! By golly!"" He stood up. ""Excuse me for a minute? I want to see if a friend is here. If he is, he has a story you should hear. Funny coincidence."" And he hurried off, leaving Thorn puzzled.

Three minutes later, while Thorn poured himself more brandy, Captain Lacey returned with an army officer, a colonel.

""Colonel Dower,"" the captain said, ""I'd like you to meet Mr. Richard Thorn, the top research man at North American Carbide & Metals. Mr. Thorn, this is Colonel Edward Dower."" They shook hands. A third glass of brandy was poured for the colonel.

""Ed,"" said Captain Lacey, ""remember that test you told me about in the Mojave Desert a couple of years ago?""

Colonel Dower frowned. ""Test? Cars?""

""No, not that one. Power supply.""

""Oh!"" His frown faded. ""You mean the crackpot with the suitcase.""

Thorn looked startled, and Captain Lacey said, ""That's the one.""

""Sure I remember,"" the colonel said. ""What about it?""

""Oh, nothing,"" Lacey said casually, ""I thought Mr. Thorn might like to hear the story if it isn't classified.""

Colonel Dower chuckled. ""Nothing classified. Just another crackpot inventor with a suitcase he claimed was a new power source. Wanted a million, tax-free, no strings attached, but wouldn't show us what's in it. Not interesting.""

""Go ahead, colonel,"" Thorn said. ""I'm interested.""

""Well, as I said, not much to it,"" the colonel said. ""He showed us his lab stuff, but it meant nothing. He had this suitcase with copper electrodes he claimed could give power. We watched his lab demos. He ran motors and other things. I don't remember what.""

""And he wanted to sell it to you sight-unseen?"" Thorn asked.

""That's right,"" the colonel said. ""He wasn't selling to the Army. We buy equipment, not ideas. But the company he was pitching wanted me to watch. I've experience with these things, so they asked for my opinion.""

""I see,"" Thorn said. ""What happened?""

""We wanted a demo in the Mojave Desert—""

""… Out in the Mojave Desert?"" the inventor asked. ""Why, Colonel Dower?""

""We want to ensure no hidden power sources are in your suitcase. We know a place in the Mojave with no power lines for miles.""

The inventor frowned at him. ""Look."" He pointed at the suitcase on the lab table. ""You can see there's no trick.""

Colonel Dower shook his head. ""You won't tell us what's in it. We only know it produces power. From what? How? You won't say. Did you ever hear of the Keely Motor?""

""No. What was it?""

""Something like this,"" the colonel said. ""Keely claimed he discovered a new power source. Perpetual motion. Harmony controlled it. He showed a flywheel in his lab that ran when he played a harmonica chord. It stopped with a sour note. He said it was in water. A pint of charged water would run a train from Philadelphia to New York and back, cheaper than coal.""

The inventor folded his arms. ""I see. Go on.""

""Well, he got investors. A lot put big money into the Keely Motor Company. He'd show them progress and get more money. He lived high. It went on for years. In the late 1890s, _The Scientific American_ exposed it. Keely died. The lab was searched. All his machines ran on compressed air hidden in the floor and tables.""

""I see,"" the inventor repeated. ""You think my invention is like that?""

""I didn't say it's fake,"" Colonel Dower said. ""But we want to test it away from your lab. Are you willing?""

""Anytime you are, colonel.""

A week later, they went to the Mojave and set up the test. The suitcase—

""… The suitcase,"" the colonel said, ""was connected to 100 light bulbs. It ran for ten hours before he shut it off."" He chuckled. ""He never let us look inside. Naturally, we wouldn't buy a pig in a poke, as they say. We told him if he showed us inside, we'd see him again. He left in a huff, and that was it.""

""How do you explain,"" Thorn asked, ""his suitcase running those lights?""

The colonel chuckled. ""Hell, we figured it out. He had a battery in there. No fancy gimmick for perpetual motion. Just a battery.""

Captain Dean Lacey was grinning.

Thorn asked, ""What was his name?""

""I don't recall. Big, blond. Swedish or Norwegian name. Sanderson? No. Something like that.""

""Sorensen?"" Thorn asked.

""That's it! Sorensen! You know him?""

""We've done business,"" Thorn said dryly.

""He didn't sell you a fake machine, did he?"" the colonel asked, laughing.

""No,"" Thorn said. ""Nobody sold us a battery disguised as perpetual motion. Our dealings with him have been profitable.""

""I'd still watch him,"" Colonel Dower said. ""Once a con man, always a con man.""

Captain Lacey rubbed his hands. ""Ed, didn't it occur to you a battery that powerful, in a suitcase, was worth a million?""

Colonel Dower looked surprised. ""Why... no. The man was a phony. He wouldn't say what the power source was."" He stopped, set his jaw, and continued. ""Besides, if it were a battery, why didn't he say so? A phony shouldn't be—"" He stopped again, looking at Lacey.

Lacey was still grinning. ""We found Sorensen's battery can run a submarine.""

""With all respect, captain,"" Thorn said, ""I think you'd have been skeptical too.""

""Oh, I'd admit that,"" Lacey said. ""But I'd have been impressed by the performance."" He looked thoughtful. ""But it lowers my opinion of your inventor to hear he tells stories. Why not just tell the truth?""

""Evidently he learned something,"" Thorn said. ""Let me tell you what happened after the contracts were signed—""

After a week of negotiation, the contracts were signed. Thorn was a little nervous. After seeing the test on Salt Flats, he knew Sorensen's battery was worth every penny. Thorn pushed for quick negotiations. A million dollars was a lot, but it was safe. The contract called for a device with specific results. If Sorensen's device didn't work, or if Thorn couldn't replicate it, Sorensen wouldn't get anything.

Now it was time to see inside the Black Suitcase. Sorensen brought it to North American Carbide & Metals' main lab.

Sorensen put it on the table but didn't open it right away. ""I want you to know, Mr. Thorn,"" he began, ""I don't know how this works. Not completely. I can show you how to build them, but I don't fully understand them.""

""That's not unusual in battery work,"" Thorn said. ""As long as it works according to the contract, we'll be satisfied.""

""All right. But you'll be surprised when you see what's in here.""

""I probably will. I've been expecting a surprise,"" Thorn said.

And he got a real surprise.

Inside was a small hydrogen pressure tank, like ones for toy balloons. There was some electronic circuitry, like a radio.

The rest was filled with batteries.

And every cell was a familiar canister. They were small, rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells, each with the North American Carbide & Metals trademark!

One lab person asked, ""What kind of joke is this?""

""Do you mean, Mr. Sorensen,"" Thorn asked calmly, ""your million-dollar process is a gimmick with our batteries?""

""No,"" Sorensen said. ""It's—""

""Wait,"" another said. ""Is it a hydrogen fuel cell?""

""In a way,"" Sorensen said. ""Yes, in a way. It's not as efficient as I'd like, but it gets power by converting hydrogen to helium. I need those batteries to start it. After it starts, these leads keep the batteries charged.""

He was interrupted by several voices talking at once. He could hardly—

""… He could hardly get a word in edgewise,"" Thorn said. He enjoyed Colonel Dower's shocked look. ""When Sorensen finally explained, we still didn't know much. But we built another one, and it worked. The contract didn't call for a specific battery. He had us.""

""Now wait,"" Colonel Dower said. ""You mean it wasn't a battery?""

""Of course not.""

""Then why all the secrecy?""

""Colonel,"" Thorn said, ""Sorensen patented that device nine years ago. It only has eight years left. But no one believed it did what he said. After years of trying, he got smart.

""He realized everyone 'knew' hydrogen fusion wasn't that simple. His theory was the problem. When he told people he had a suitcase-sized hydrogen fusion device, he was dismissed as a nut.

""I investigated after he gave us the information. (He signed over the patent to us, more than the contract called for, for a job with us, to help develop the fusion device.)

""He got smart. If theory was the problem, he'd tell them nothing.

""You know the results, Colonel Dower. He got someone to test the machine. Someone looked at what it could do.

""But that wasn't enough. He didn't have a good reason to keep it secret, so everyone was suspicious.""

""But why tell you it was a battery?"" Captain Lacey asked.

""That was probably suggested by Colonel Dower's reaction,"" Thorn said. ""Someone—maybe George Gamow—once said a theory isn't enough; it has to make sense.

""Sorensen's theory of hydrogen fusion producing electric current didn't make sense. It was true, but didn't make sense.

""So he came up with a theory that did make sense. If people wanted to think it was 'just a battery,' he'd sell it as a battery. And we believed that theory. It wasn't true, but it made sense.

""As far as I was concerned, it was natural for a man with a new battery to keep it secret like that.

""After we invested a million, we had to investigate. It worked, so we had to find out why and how.""

""Naturally,"" Colonel Dower said, looking uncomfortable. ""I presume this is secret? What about the Russians? Couldn't they get the patent?""

""They could have,"" Thorn admitted, ""but they didn't. They dismissed him as a crackpot. They never requested the patent. The patent number is now secret, and if anyone asks, the Patent Office says there are no copies available. The FBI will find out who asks.""

""Well,"" Colonel Dower said, ""at least I'm glad I wasn't the only one who didn't believe him.""

Captain Lacey chuckled. ""And Mr. Thorn believed a lie.""

""Only because it made more sense than the truth,"" Thorn said. ""And,"" he added, ""you shouldn't laugh, captain. We suckered the Navy almost the same way.""

Question: What is in the Little Black Box? [: missing]

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of With No Strings Attached, by Gordon Randall Garrett (AKA David Gordon)",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the skepticism and secrecy surrounding a revolutionary power source, initially disguised as a simple battery, and the challenges of proving its legitimacy and value. The narrative explores the tension between the inventor's claims and the disbelief from both military and industrial entities, who are accustomed to dealing with frauds and require tangible proofs of the invention's efficacy. The dilemma is further complicated by the inventor's strategic decision to obscure the true nature of his invention due to past failures in convincing others of its potential, ultimately leading to a scenario where the truth is stranger than the lie presented. The story examines themes of innovation, trust, and the obstacles faced by groundbreaking technologies in gaining acceptance.",How do you convince the world your invention isn't a scam when nobody believes in hydrogen fusion in a suitcase?,"What would you do if your life's work was dismissed as a hoax, but you knew it could change the world?",How do you sell the truth when everyone around you believes a lie that makes more sense?,science fiction,comedy,good vs. evil,What was unusual about the submarine _Ambitious Brill_'s trip?,"The submarine _Ambitious Brill_ had more high-ranking officers aboard than usual, and the entire trip was conducted underwater, which is rare for a Diesel-electric sub.",Why were the crew members puzzled about the battery room?,"The crew members were puzzled because some of the battery cells had been removed to make room for a steel box, and the remaining battery cells were not used at all during the trip.",What might be the reason Sorensen didn't patent his invention?,"Sorensen didn't patent his invention because he believed that battery-making is an art and that a patent might not hold up in court. He also wanted to avoid the complications of patent pools, where companies could use his invention without proper compensation.",How did Sorensen's approach to selling his invention change over time?,"Initially, Sorensen tried to sell his invention as a revolutionary power source, but he faced skepticism and disbelief. Eventually, he decided to present it as a 'battery' because it was a more believable concept, even though it wasn't true. This change in approach helped him successfully sell his invention.",Do you think Sorensen's decision to keep the true nature of his invention a secret was justified?,"Sorensen's decision to keep the true nature of his invention a secret can be seen as justified because it allowed him to overcome skepticism and secure a deal. By presenting it as a battery, he provided a plausible explanation that people could accept, which ultimately led to the successful commercialization of his invention.",What might have happened if Sorensen had revealed the true nature of his invention from the start?,"If Sorensen had revealed the true nature of his invention from the start, he might have faced continued disbelief and skepticism, potentially preventing him from securing any deals. The scientific community and potential buyers might have dismissed his claims as impossible, and he could have struggled to find support or funding for further development.",0.7537467869,0.7538206604,0.04702563894,0.5330358025,0.7470490553,0.741242282,0.4521619821,0.4455818702,0.7300605033,0.265920242,0.5448746283,0.04353631773,0.7729138898,0.7269188163,0.1186579095,0.7494362008,0.1500798422,0.1562543902,0.05438633596,0.7596863894,0.2391269164,0.7320415859,0.4386317334,0.4527118732,0.7669403388,0.1418289608,0.04960785162,0.05890453276,0.7623285766,0.7437731878,0.2401092803,0.376013564,0.1433172505,0.4418443745,0.7428072876,0.770190369,0.7144754416,0.7488847991,0.4335872944,0.1566670167,0.03864602604,0.7437020851,0.04260287172,0.7651351055,0.5438368836,1,0.2612808802,0.4436106951,0.03872397916,0.2522896099,0.1493745492,0.8429705888,0.127130153,0.7573577896,0.7594847267,0.5082374894,0.2629630131,0.7704948392,0.4594784985,0.04658119473,0.4423995216,0.3462528756,0.2666876364,0.04649612719,0.7323648018,0.0579886933,0.2563081506,0.7540418416,0.76505009,0.5411367782
067.txt,"""Well, there are different kinds of natives, some just as good as any white man,"" said Mr. Thomas Potter, the second mate of the island-trading ship _Reconnaisance_, as he and Denison, the supercargo, walked on the ship's deck one night. ""When I was a sailor, I didn't like sharing a bunk with a native, but after a while, I realized that a Kanaka or a Maori is better than most of the messy sailors we have nowadays. I've never seen a native sailor who was dirty—they love the water too much. Look at these Rotumah guys on board here—if there's no wind, they jump overboard to swim instead of sleeping. White sailors in this Island trade are lazy and dirty. A Kanaka is worth three of them. Did you see that photograph in my cabin? The one with the ship's crew standing on deck?""

""Yes, I did,"" replied Denison.

""Well, that's the crew of the _Fanny Long_, and among them is a guy I'm going to tell you about—a fellow named Sarro. We had that picture taken in Hobart after a successful sperm whaling trip. The skipper and owners had us all photographed together. I was the second mate, and Sarro was one of the boat steerers. We had sailed together before, once on the old _Meteor_ barque, catching laborers for Fiji, and once on a New Bedford sperm whaler. He liked me, so whenever I got a new ship, he usually signed on too.

""I got tired of whaling; I had two ribs broken on that cruise in the _Fanny Lang_ by a whale. So after getting my money, I thought of going to Sydney by steamboat when Sarro came up to me.

""'Got your money, Sarro?' I asked.

""'Yes,' he answered. 'What are you going to do now, Mr. Potter?'

""'I'm going to Sydney to look for another ship.'

""'All right,' he said quietly. 'I'll come too. I don't want to go whaling anymore.'

""Sure enough, when I went on board the steamer, there he was, sitting on his chest and smoking his pipe, waiting for me.

""In Sydney, there was a big schooner getting ready for a trading trip to the Solomon Islands. I knew the skipper, who got me the job of chief mate, and Sarro, who came every day to ask me not to forget him, was hired as an able seaman.

""What did he look like? Well, he was a short, strong guy with a chest like a bull. He was darker than a Samoan or Tahiti man because of his life at sea, and had straight, black hair. He usually only spoke when spoken to and kept to himself, but wasn't sulky.""

""Where was he from?"" Denison asked.

""Ah, now you're asking,"" said Potter. ""There was a nasty supercargo with us on that trip—a real rude, bossy guy. He acted like he owned the Pacific. One day, he was organizing his trade goods and called for a couple of hands to help. The skipper sent Sarro and another native sailor to him. We were anchored in Marau Sound in the Solomons, and the sun was blistering. The supercargo came on deck, flopped into a chair, and said, 'That Sarro is a smart guy, Potter. Where's he from?'

""I didn’t know, so I said so. The supercargo grunted and said he'd ask Sarro himself. A bit later, Sarro and the other sailor were going forward for their dinner.

""'Hey, you,' said the supercargo to Sarro, tapping him with his foot as he passed, 'what island are you from?'

""Sarro turned quickly. I saw his face, and his deep-set eyes seemed to flash angrily at the guy in the chair. His hands clenched, but he said nothing, just stood there like a statue. Then he bent close to the man's face and put his fists behind him.

""'Here, Sarro,' I said, grabbing his arm, 'what's all this about? What's wrong?'

""He pushed me aside like I was nothing, then stood up straight, spat on the deck at the supercargo's feet, and said, 'You dog, when we get ashore, I will fight you!'

""Warby—that was the supercargo's name—was no coward, but he seemed worried when Sarro called him a dog. He jumped up and said, 'You damned Kanaka! You're drunk! You've been sneaking gin from the trade-room, and I'll beat you.'

""Before anyone could stop them, they were fighting. In less than two minutes, Sarro had Warby by the throat, lifted him off his feet, and slammed him down on the deck. He lay there stunned. I was pretty happy about it because we all hated him for his bullying and foul talk. None of us hurried to help him up. The skipper came up and ordered me to put Sarro in irons, though I could tell he wasn't too keen on it. But it had to be done, so I did it. Sarro held out his hands quietly, and I led him forward, telling him to stay strong. I knew the captain would release him the next morning. He nodded and said, 'All right, Mr. Potter. But when we get ashore, I must kill that man.'

""'Why, Sarro,' I said, 'you can't talk like that. You've nearly cracked his skull. Don't go on like that, or it'll be worse for you.'

""He nodded again. 'I know. But I've been looking for that man for more than five years.'

""'Do you know him?'

""'Yes, I know him now. When I saw him roll up his sleeve in the trade-room and saw a tattoo mark on his arm, I knew him.'

""Of course, I asked him what Warby had done to him, but he wouldn't say. So, telling one of the hands to give him his pipe and tobacco, I went aft and told the skipper there seemed to be an old grudge.

""'Probably,' said the skipper. 'Warby is a real scoundrel. He was only put on this ship at the last moment, or else I would have opposed him coming aboard. He's got a bad reputation.'

""Warby lay in his bunk for the rest of the day, but in the evening, he came on deck and roughly asked the skipper what he was going to do with Sarro.

""'Keep him in irons for a day or two, I suppose. What more can I do?'

""Warby looked at him for a moment and sneered, saying that some captains would have tied Sarro up and whipped him.

""'No doubt,' said the skipper, looking him in the eye, 'especially in the kind of ships you've sailed on. But that won't happen here.'

""The supercargo muttered something and turned away. The next morning, he asked the captain how long he meant to keep Sarro in irons.

""'Till after breakfast.'

""Warby got angry and said he protested against Sarro being freed. 'He'll murder me,' he said, looking scared.

""The skipper laughed. 'You're making too much of it, Mr. Warby. He's one of the best and quietest men aboard. If you hadn't kicked him and sworn at him, he wouldn't have fought you. I'm not keeping him in irons, and that's that.'

""After breakfast, I went forward to take the irons off Sarro. He was sitting against the windlass, smoking.

""'Here, Sarro,' I said, 'I've come to take off your handcuffs, but you must promise not to fight with the supercargo again. If you don't promise, the captain says he'll keep you in irons until we get to Fiji and then send you to jail.'

""He promised, and from his quiet, soft manner, I felt sure he was over his anger and was feeling a bit worried about it. He turned to work quietly and was soon sent ashore with a water-fetching party, being in charge of the boat with native sailors. When he came back with the first lot of casks, he told me the bush around the watering place was full of pigeons. The captain, hearing this, decided to go shoot some, and Mr. Warby wanted to join him.

""So off they went—skipper, supercargo, and Sarro with his boat crew. We on board soon heard the two guns firing and looked forward to pigeon stew for supper. I didn't expect to see them back until supper-time, knowing the boat had to tow the casks to the ship, which was about half a mile from the beach. But around four o'clock, I saw the boat rushing off and pulling hard for the ship. Knowing there was no danger from natives there, I couldn't figure it out, but in a few minutes, they arrived alongside. Looking over the side, I saw Sarro sitting next to the captain, between him and Mr. Warby, with his eyes closed. I thought he was dead at first.

""We quickly lifted him on deck and carried him into the cabin, where I saw he had a bullet wound in his shoulder; the ball had gone right through. The skipper, who wasn't much of a talker, told me Warby had accidentally shot him. I looked at Warby. His face was pale, but he met my eyes without flinching.

""It didn't take the captain long to dress the wound. Half an hour later, when I came below again, Sarro was sitting up on some cushions, smoking one of the captain's cigars, looking like nothing had happened. He smiled when he saw me and held out his hand.

""'I'm all right, Mr. Potter,' he said. 'Not going to die this time.'

""I was about to ask what happened when Robertson—the skipper—called me into his room. He was as serious as a judge. Closing his cabin door, he said, 'Sarro will recover, but this is ugly; I believe Warby tried to murder him.'

""Then he told me what happened. Leaving the rest of the crew to fill the water casks, they went to shoot pigeons. Sarro went along to pick up and carry the birds. About an hour later, they saw a wild boar rush by. Robertson fired both barrels and wounded it, but it didn't stop. Warby had one barrel empty. He reloaded with a bullet, and the three gave chase, Sarro leading, Warby close behind. At a riverbank, Sarro dove into some tall grass. Moments later, Robertson heard Warby shout he saw the animal lying down and fired. The captain, a short distance behind, reached the spot at the same time as Warby, and there was the boar, with Sarro beside it, blood pouring from his shoulder. Sarro sat up, supporting himself on his left hand. The skipper helped him up, and Warby tried to help too, but Sarro turned on him, cursing and accusing him of attempted murder. Warby swore he hadn't seen him when he fired, but Sarro fainted from blood loss, so they carried him to the boat.

""That was the story so far, and Robertson asked what I thought of it.

""I had been shipmates with Sarro for five or six years and never knew him to lie; but I couldn't believe Warby would try to murder him in cold blood. The skipper took a grim view and said if we met a warship, he'd put Warby in irons and hand him over for attempted murder. Then we went into the main cabin and sat down, telling the steward to call Warby.

""Warby came below at once. He glanced quickly at Sarro, then at the skipper and me, and sat down quietly. In less than a minute, the captain told him his suspicions and what he planned to do if we met a warship.

""I thought Warby would bluster and swear, but he didn't. He listened quietly. Then he stood, put his hands on the table, and said, 'Before God, I swear I'm innocent. I did not fire at that man; I didn't even see him after he went into the grass. I did mean to get back at Sarro for nearly breaking my skull the other day, but then I remembered he had reason to hate me, and I was waiting for a chance to make it up. I'm no cowardly murderer; when I fired, I aimed at the boar or what I thought was the boar, struggling in the grass. You can put me in irons now or lock me in my cabin. I'm not sitting at the same table with men who think I'm a murderer.'

""There was something in his voice that made us believe him. Then he paced the cabin and stepped up to the wounded man.

""'Sarro, I did you wrong a long time ago; but I'm sorry now—I've been sorry ever since. I wouldn't have known you yesterday if you hadn't looked at me and spoken. It's been ten years since that day, Sarro.'

""The wounded man looked up, searching Warby's face all the time he spoke; then his eyes dropped again, but he said nothing. Warby continued, speaking to all of us.

""'I was supercargo on the _Manola_ brig, and Sarro was one of the hands. One day, in Apia, a bag of dollars was stolen from my cabin. The steward said he saw Sarro ashore spending money freely. The captain and I searched his chest and found about twenty Mexican dollars among his clothes. There had been nearly five hundred in the bag. Sarro swore he hadn't stolen the money and said the money he spent ashore was five dollars from San Francisco. But we didn't believe him and flogged him to make him confess. Then we put him in irons for a week. He still swore he hadn't stolen it, and I, thinking he lied, beat him again. That night he escaped ashore, and we thought the money was lost. A week later, when the steward was ashore, the mate and I searched his cabin. We found nothing there, but we did in the pantry—the missing bag of dollars, all but the twenty put in Sarro's chest, hidden in a barrel of flour.'

""Sarro almost cried and said, 'I told you, Mr. Warby, I didn't steal that money.'

""'No, Sarro, I know you didn't,' said Warby. 'The steward confessed, saying he took twenty dollars out of the bag and put it in your chest when no one was looking.'

""Sarro sighed, looking pleased, and his face lit up.

""The big supercargo came closer and held out his hand.

""'Look, Sarro, I was wrong yesterday, but you angered me; I'm sorry for what I did on the _Manola_; but I swear, Sarro, I didn't fire at you.'

""Sarro's eyes seemed to look right through Warby; then they turned towards the skipper and me.

""'I believe you, Mr. Warby,' said the skipper, shaking hands with the supercargo.

""I believed him too, as he seemed genuinely upset, so I shook his hand as well.

""Then Sarro extended his tattooed hand.

""'And me too, Mr. Warby.'

""The supercargo gently shook it, careful not to hurt Sarro's shoulder, then hurried past us on deck.

""From then on, Warby changed. He looked after Sarro while he was laid up as if he were his own brother, not just a Kanaka sailor.

""After leaving Marau Sound, we headed north to Bougainville Island. It took over a month, and by then Sarro was as strong as ever, and the skipper and I had become friends with the supercargo. We found he had many good qualities. Ten or twelve years ago, the Solomon Islands were a place to test a man's mettle—it's not much different now. If you didn't die from fever, you might get attacked by the natives, and Warby had rare courage. He never risked the crew's safety but took any risks himself. We cruised from Marau Sound to Bougainville's north end without losing a man, only facing a few arrows or shots.

""Just as we were about to head north past Bouka Island, we saw a ship's hull ashore in a small bay. We went closer and saw a native village nearby, and the vessel was a schooner of about a hundred tons. There were no signs of any boats, and she seemed stripped of all her gear.

""We armed two boats—one, led by Mr. Warby, was to land and investigate; the other was a backup in case of attack. I led the second boat with four white sailors; Warby had Sarro and four other natives. The skipper told us to check the wreck, see what the natives said about it, and report back.

""We rowed to the wreck as close as the low tide allowed. Warby and I walked over and found she was stripped of everything valuable, even chain-plates cut out, decks partly burnt, and anchors and cables gone; she was just a shell.

""'Looted by the natives,' I said to Warby. 'Hope the crew escaped in boats; better drowned than eaten by these natives.'

""'We'll see,' he said. 'I think they got away. Look at those natives waiting on the beach; if they attacked the vessel, they'd be hiding or attacking us. Let's go.'

""We returned to the boats and rowed to the village, about 800 yards away, Warby's boat leading. About thirty or forty natives were waiting, armed but friendly.

""Warby boldly jumped onto the beach, telling his crew to keep the boat ready in case of trouble, and went to shake hands with some natives. I and my crew kept our rifles hidden but ready.

""In about five minutes, Warby called that it was all right. The natives said the vessel broke its cables, went ashore, and was abandoned by the crew in two boats. He told me to wait as he was going to the chief's house to look at the gear taken from the schooner, possibly to buy it. First, he asked Sarro to pass a 12 lb. case of tobacco as a gift for the chief.

""He took the case from Sarro, handed it to the chief, and went off with them—him in the middle of a bunch of armed natives; but he had done this before, so we weren't too worried.

""We waited, boats facing the beach, watching the house he entered. Suddenly, we saw him rush out, fall to his knees trying to draw his revolver, but then he was being attacked with tomahawks and clubs! He died quickly.

""We opened fire, and the natives vanished, then began shooting at us with muskets and arrows. One of my men was hit, and before I could stop him, Sarro jumped out and ran up the beach, rifle in hand, to where Warby's body lay.

""He reached it, avoiding hits, just as a big native charged him with a tomahawk. No time to aim, but he fired, and the native fell. In seconds, he lifted Warby's body over his shoulder and ran to the boats.

""By then, I and two crew members had jumped out and ran to meet him, firing as we went. We reached him just as he fell, a bullet shattering his hip.

""Dropping our rifles, we lifted him and Warby's body and managed to get into the boat, pushing off under cover from the ship's cannons.

""Sarro lived two more days—he died the same morning we prepared to bury Warby on a small island between Bouka and Bougainville. We made only one trip ashore. Poor guy! He had a good heart, and his last words were that he 'was glad Mr. Warby wasn't eaten.'

""Ah, as you say, Mr. Denison, the rotten South Seas are no place for a white man. Goodnight.""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around themes of prejudice, redemption, and reconciliation. This is primarily manifested through the relationship between Sarro, a native sailor, and Mr. Warby, the supercargo. The tension between these two characters stems from a past injustice where Sarro was wrongfully accused and punished for theft—a crime actually committed by someone else. This creates an underlying animosity in Sarro towards Warby, which escalates when Warby unknowingly confronts Sarro and later accidentally shoots him during a hunting trip.

The story explores the dilemmas of trust, forgiveness, and understanding across cultural and racial divides. Sarro's initial animosity towards Warby is compounded by the supercargo's authoritative and dismissive attitude, common in the colonial context. However, as the narrative progresses, Warby's genuine remorse and the revelation of Sarro's innocence in the past incident lead to a moment of reconciliation between them. This development is significant, as it highlights the possibility of overcoming prejudice and misunderstanding through empathy and acknowledgment of past wrongs.

The story's resolution, where Sarro sacrifices his life to save Warby's body from being desecrated, underscores the themes of loyalty and redemption. It suggests that despite the deep-rooted conflicts and injustices faced by individuals, there is room for personal growth and mutual respect. The broader conflict of cultural and racial tensions in the South Seas serves as a backdrop to the personal story of Sarro and Warby, illustrating the complex dynamics of human relationships in a colonial setting.","If you could save your enemy's life, knowing they once betrayed you, would you?",Imagine being accused of a crime you didn't commit.

068.txt,"Mryna Brill wanted to ride the god-car above the rain mist. She hadn't believed in the taboos or the Earth-god for a while. She didn't even think she lived on Earth. This paradise of green forests and streams was called Rythar.

When Mryna was fourteen, she first realized the truth when she asked the Earth-god what was above the rain mist, and he ignored her. It was a simple question, but instead of answering, he repeated the taboo about avoiding the Old Village because of the Sickness.

Being curious, Mryna went to the Old Village. The kids would often run through the ruins, thinking a charm would protect them. But Mryna didn't believe in the Sickness. She had asked the Earth-god about sickness once and received a detailed answer. No one on Rythar had ever been sick, so she thought the taboo was just a silly superstition.

The Old Village was small, with three roads lined with burnt-out houses. It wasn't scary, just old and covered in grass. Mryna searched the ruins for weeks before finding anything—a few burnt pages of a pamphlet about a world called Rythar, ""the jewel of the Sirian Solar System."" It was addressed to ""Earthmen everywhere,"" and Mryna realized Rythar was her home.

At fifteen, Mryna found an astronomy textbook. It talked about the universe beyond the rain mist. Mryna learned that Earth was actually Rythar, a planet spinning through space. The new knowledge was overwhelming, but it explained why the rain mist glowed by day and darkened at night. Mryna kept her discovery a secret for six years.

After the metal men came, she destroyed everything so no one would know the Earth-god was a man. She had discovered this during a moment when the man's face on the screen became angry when she asked about planets. That night, metal men arrived. They were big and clunky and forced the kids together while they destroyed the Old Village ruins.

As time passed, Mryna's fear faded, but one thing mattered: she knew the Earth-god was a man. On Rythar, there were a hundred women and thirty men. All the boys had mates by seventeen, leaving seventy girls unmarried. Mryna didn't want to be a second wife. She wanted her own man, so why not the Earth-god?

To escape, Mryna volunteered at the answer house, where anyone could contact god for information or equipment. Supplies came in a god-car, a large cylinder from the sky, and Mryna had to unload it. She planned to hide in it and go beyond the rain mist.

After two weeks, she did it. She hid in the god-car, sealed the door, and felt the tremendous speed. She passed out from the force. When she awoke, the compartment was hot, and a liquid sprayed, burning her skin and dissolving her clothes. Naked and terrified, she screamed, but the sound was lost in the noise.

The god-car stopped, and she floated in weightlessness. She tried to enter the circular room but found it hard to move. Finally, she entered a corridor with a sense of gravity. She saw stars through a mica wall and realized she was in space. The sight was stunning but also terrifying.

Mryna found a sleeping room and some clothes. While searching, she met an old man who thought she was a patient. She realized she wasn't alone here and that this place was some kind of hospital.

Later, she overheard a conversation about the Guardian Wheel, a hospital for people from Earth. They talked about the success of treating patients here and the ores from Rythar paying for the operation. Mryna felt used. Rythar was being exploited, and she decided to return and tell others.

Mryna tried to go back but accidentally entered a ship meant for someone else. It started moving toward Earth. She saw the Wheel explode, realizing they destroyed it to stop the Sickness she might have brought.

On the way to Earth, Mryna learned from films that the Sickness had destroyed the original colony on Rythar. Only children born there were immune. The Wheel was built to isolate the Sickness. When she reached Earth, she warned them of the danger. But they didn't believe her, thinking it was a trick.

Mryna was frustrated. Earth had made a mistake by not telling the truth. She realized that truth makes people mature, not lies. She hoped they would listen and change their ways, even as she faced the unknown on Earth.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around Mryna Brill's struggle between the pursuit of truth and the oppressive control of misinformation. Mryna lives on Rythar, a colony shrouded in mystery and controlled by the Earth-god, who is later revealed to be a man manipulating the population with taboos and secrecy. Her journey begins with curiosity and defiance of the taboos, leading her to uncover the truth about her world and its connection to Earth.

The dilemma intensifies as Mryna discovers that Rythar is not a paradise but a quarantined colony exploited for its resources. The Earth-god's deception is rooted in the need to protect the remaining population from the Sickness, a disease that devastated the original colonists. This revelation challenges Mryna's belief in the benevolence of the Earth-god and the structure of her society.

Mryna's conflict is both internal and external. Internally, she grapples with the implications of her discoveries and her desire for autonomy and truth. Externally, she faces the oppressive control of the Earth-god's system and the broader exploitation by Earth. Her decision to stow away in the god-car represents her attempt to escape and seek freedom, but it also leads her to the harsh reality of exploitation and the dangers of the Sickness.

Ultimately, the story highlights the theme of truth versus deception. Mryna's journey illustrates the importance of truth in achieving maturity and freedom, as well as the destructive consequences of lies and manipulation. The narrative underscores the moral that withholding truth stunts growth and that only through confronting reality can individuals and societies truly evolve.",Imagine discovering your paradise is just a lie to keep you safe from a deadly Sickness.

It’s hard to understand a report about 1,327 cases of spinal problems, but when you hear about Mamie O’Grady, whose drunk husband tried to hurt her, it’s different. That’s why big news about battles doesn’t bother us as much as hearing about a local boy getting hurt.

Gertie Slayback was just one of the many working women in the city. She was just a tiny part of the city’s huge population. When she came home, no one was waiting for her, and when she left in the morning, no one missed her. Some people like this freedom, but others wish they had a home and family.

Gertie was one who longed for a home. Her room was empty and lonely, and she only had one picture on the wall—a snowy scene with a cozy cottage. She imagined the warmth inside that cottage. For two years and eight months, she also had a small photo of Mr. James P. Batch on her mirror. She imagined a life with him, even though they were very different.

Gertie met Mr. Batch by accident one evening. He mistook her for someone else, and they ended up having dinner together. Gertie was tired of her routine life, and Mr. Batch, who was young and cheerful, brought a little excitement. They spent many Saturday nights together, enjoying simple meals and movies.

One Saturday, Gertie was waiting for Mr. Batch, but he didn’t show up. She followed him and saw him with another woman. Hurt, she confronted him. Gertie liked him a lot, but she realized he didn’t feel the same way. She wanted him to be a better person and not waste his life with the wrong crowd.

Gertie tried to get Mr. Batch to see that he was wasting his potential. She cared for him deeply and wanted him to make something of himself. She was willing to do anything for him, even if it meant letting him go to become a better person. In the end, Gertie realized she had to let him make his own choices.

Gertie’s story shows that sometimes we have to let go of the people we care about, hoping they’ll find their way.

However, when she discovers his interest in another woman, she is confronted with the painful truth that her feelings for him are not reciprocated in the same way.

071.txt,"In a poor neighborhood, there’s a High Street with two rows of tiny, old houses. These houses are almost falling apart, with crooked windows and roofs covered in moss. The area is dusty and not much grows there except for a few pollard willows and elder bushes. The windows in these houses look at each other suspiciously, like they’re up to something.

The street is muddy and full of holes from rainstorms. There are piles of broken bricks and stones overgrown with weeds, signs of abandoned attempts to build new homes. Up on the hill, there are beautiful stone houses with gardens and churches.

At the end of this street, there’s a big, old, two-story house owned by a merchant named Petounnikoff. It looks even worse than the others, with crooked walls and windows that no longer fit right. Its roof droops as if the house is bowing down, ready to collapse.

The house has a yard with a broken front gate, and in the back, there’s a shed that used to be a forge but is now a cheap lodging house run by a retired cavalry officer named Aristide Fomitch Kouvalda.

Inside, the lodging house is dark and smoky, with a big stove in the middle and wooden bunks along the walls. The floor is muddy, and everything smells bad, like smoke and sweat. Kouvalda, the owner, spends his days sitting by the door or at the nearby beerhouse.

Kouvalda is a big, strong man with a pock-marked face and a wild, yellow beard. He’s always chewing on a pipe and has a loud, booming voice. He wears an old military coat and a greasy cap, and he’s usually a bit drunk but always in a good mood.

At night, new people would come looking for a place to sleep. Kouvalda would ask for their papers and charge a small fee to stay. He didn’t provide food or drinks, but he would direct them to the beerhouse if they asked.

Kouvalda was well-liked by the outcasts of the town for his jokes and his way of speaking. Sometimes, someone who used to stay there would return, better dressed and with money to spend. They would thank Kouvalda for his help and insist on buying him a drink.

But often, these people would end up back in the lodging house, broke again. Kouvalda would lend them money, advising them to save up and get back on their feet. He was like a friend, even though his advice was often mixed with insults.

One of the regulars was a former schoolteacher who had lost his job and started drinking. He would earn money by writing for newspapers and would share it with Kouvalda, planning to leave the lodging house once he had enough. But Kouvalda’s persuasive speeches often led them both back to drinking.

The schoolteacher was kindhearted and spent his money on the children of High Street, buying them food and playing with them in the fields. He had a soft spot for them, even letting them call him by his first name.

Every day, the schoolteacher would bring a newspaper, and Kouvalda's crew would gather to listen. They would discuss the news, with Kouvalda often ranting against the merchants and shopkeepers he despised.

They also played cards, but Martianoff, one of them, couldn’t be trusted, as he had a habit of cheating. Stories were shared, often exaggerated and full of imaginary adventures. But on rainy days, they would huddle in the beerhouse, where they were known for their rowdiness and loud opinions.

The neighborhood was divided over who was better, Kouvalda or the schoolteacher. People admired Kouvalda’s boldness, while others respected the schoolteacher’s intelligence.

Despite their grim lives, they found a strange comfort in their discussions and shared jokes, even as they waited for hard times to pass.

**II**

Life in the neighborhood was harsh, but it could always get worse. One day, Kouvalda sat outside his lodging house, watching the construction of a new factory by merchant Petounnikoff. This factory was a constant reminder that their poor home might soon be taken away.

Kouvalda hated Petounnikoff, who was always looking down on him and his friends. The merchant had once insulted Kouvalda, and they had been at odds ever since. Petounnikoff was a sly, greedy man, but Kouvalda had a plan.

Kouvalda noticed that the new factory's wall was built too close to the vodka shop owned by Vaviloff. He suspected that the wall was on Vaviloff’s land, which could mean trouble for Petounnikoff. Kouvalda quickly told Vaviloff about it and together they planned to take legal action.

The news excited Kouvalda's friends, who were eager to see Petounnikoff get what he deserved. They laughed at the thought of the rich merchant being forced to tear down his factory wall.

But when Petounnikoff finally came to measure the land, his son went into the vodka shop to talk with Vaviloff. The friends guessed that a deal was being made, and Kouvalda realized that Vaviloff might have been bribed to keep quiet.

Kouvalda was furious. He knew they would soon be evicted, and he had no idea where they would go. But he tried to cheer his friends up, saying that life was full of surprises and they would find a way to manage.

Meanwhile, Vaviloff was indeed bribed by Petounnikoff and agreed to drop the lawsuit. The merchant promised Vaviloff that the new factory would bring more business to his vodka shop.

When Kouvalda confronted Vaviloff, demanding a share of the bribe for his help in discovering the mistake, Vaviloff had no choice but to agree. Kouvalda forced him to give them a feast with the money he made from the deal.

The outcasts gathered in the yard for the feast, drinking and eating as they joked about their fate. Kouvalda looked at his friends, realizing they were all in the same boat, drifting through life without any real direction.

As they sat together, the sound of a carriage drew their attention. It was the schoolteacher, being brought home by a colleague. The schoolteacher was very ill, and soon it became clear that he was dying.

The mood shifted, and the friends gathered around the schoolteacher's body. Kouvalda, though drunk, felt a deep sadness for his friend. They all knew the schoolteacher had been the best of them, and now he was gone.

As they sat in silence, the rain began to fall, and the outcasts were left to face their uncertain futures without their friend.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the struggle between the impoverished residents of the High Street, particularly those living in the lodging house run by Aristide Fomitch Kouvalda, and the looming threat of displacement posed by the wealthy merchant Petounnikoff. This conflict is emblematic of the broader social and economic disparities between the poor and the rich in the neighborhood.

On one hand, Kouvalda and his friends, including the schoolteacher and other outcasts, find a sense of camaraderie and resilience in their shared adversity. They rely on humor, discussions, and mutual support to cope with their harsh realities. However, their way of life is precarious, as they face the constant threat of eviction due to Petounnikoff's construction of a new factory, which symbolizes the encroachment of wealth and power on their fragile existence.

On the other hand, there is an internal conflict within Kouvalda and his group, as they grapple with their own limitations and the cycle of poverty and alcohol that keeps them from improving their situation. The schoolteacher's death underscores the tragic nature of their lives and the fleeting nature of any hope for change.

The dilemma is further complicated by the betrayal of Vaviloff, who chooses financial gain over solidarity with Kouvalda and his friends. This betrayal highlights the difficulty of maintaining unity among the oppressed when faced with personal survival challenges.

Ultimately, the story delves into themes of poverty, social injustice, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The conflict between the residents of High Street and Petounnikoff serves as a microcosm of the broader societal struggles between the powerless and the powerful.",Would you stand up to a rich bully if it meant losing your home?,"Would you take money to betray your neighbors, knowing it could save you?","You're watching a factory go up, knowing it might mean the end of your world.",historical fiction,tragedy,friendship,"Who owns the big, old house at the end of High Street?","The big, old house at the end of High Street is owned by a merchant named Petounnikoff.",Why do the people in the neighborhood like Kouvalda?,"The people in the neighborhood like Kouvalda because of his jokes, his way of speaking, and his willingness to help others, even though his advice is often mixed with insults.",What might happen to Kouvalda and his friends if the factory is built?,"If the factory is built, Kouvalda and his friends might be evicted from their lodging house, as the new construction could lead to their poor home being taken away.",How does the relationship between Kouvalda and the schoolteacher reflect the theme of friendship?,"The relationship between Kouvalda and the schoolteacher reflects the theme of friendship through their mutual support and shared experiences.

Why or why not?,"Vaviloff's decision to accept the bribe from Petounnikoff can be seen as pragmatic, as it promises more business for his vodka shop.

072.txt,"The two months I spent at Newport with my Aunt Eliza Huell were the months that changed my life. Aunt Eliza was not only sick but also involved in a lawsuit. She invited me to join her, not because she liked me, but because I was helpful. My mom insisted I go because Aunt Eliza was rich and we were poor.

I took a break from teaching music, packed my clothes, and headed to New York with the five dollars Aunt Eliza sent for my ticket. I arrived at her house early in the morning and was greeted by James, her servant, who told me Aunt Eliza was very sick. As soon as I entered, I heard her ring her bell impatiently.

""She wants hot milk,"" James said, so I went to the kitchen, heated some milk, and took it to her.

""Here is your milk, Aunt Eliza. You sent for me to help, so here I am.""

""I expected you an hour ago. Ring the bell.""

I did as she asked.

""Your mother is well, I suppose. She would have sent you even if she were sick.""

""Yes, she would. She thinks it's a good idea for me to come.""

Mrs. Roll, the housekeeper, then came in, and Aunt Eliza asked her to prepare breakfast for me.

""I don't go downstairs in the mornings yet,"" Aunt Eliza said. ""But Mrs. Roll will take care of you.""

At the beginning of my visits with Aunt Eliza, I always thought about how different her life was from ours. We lived day-to-day, but everything in her home was old and valuable, and it all belonged to my grandfather. If I had been home, I might have felt angry about it, but there, I felt like I was in a dream.

Later that day, Aunt Eliza decided we would go to Newport on Saturday. I informed her I had no new clothes to bring. She asked if I had a black silk dress, and I told her I didn't think one was necessary for the summer.

""Who ever heard of a girl of twenty-four without a black silk dress!""

She sent Mrs. Roll to buy a beautiful silk dress for me, which was made by a fancy dressmaker by Friday. She also secretly bought me a white straw bonnet with roses and a pretty shawl.

We arrived in Newport on Sunday and stayed at a quiet hotel. Aunt Eliza, who was always worried about her lawsuit, was not pleased to see the Uxbridge family, whose lawyers were against her in the lawsuit.

""The sly, methodical dogs! But I shall beat Lemorne yet!""

The lawsuit was about a piece of land that had become valuable, and the Huell family was known for being involved in legal battles. I wasn't bothered by it like Aunt Eliza was.

""How will you amuse yourself then, Aunt?"" I asked.

""I'll adopt some boys to inherit what I save from Lemorne.""

After our sea bath, which tired her, Aunt Eliza sent me on rides in the carriage every day, dressed in my new clothes. She wanted me to wear them out in the fog.

During one of my rides, I saw the Uxbridge carriage and a man on a horse looking at me. I had a feeling I had seen him before. Later, I learned he was Mr. Edward Uxbridge, the brain of the law firm against Aunt Eliza.

Mr. Van Horn, Aunt Eliza's lawyer, came to Newport to discuss the lawsuit. He introduced me to Mr. Uxbridge during a ride, and we began to see each other more often.

One day, instead of going to church, I took a walk and found a quiet place by the sea. There, I unexpectedly met Mr. Uxbridge, and we talked. He asked if he could visit me, and although I didn't say yes or no, I knew he would come.

Aunt Eliza seemed to grow fonder of Newport, and we settled into a routine. Mr. Uxbridge and I continued to meet, and he even escorted me home from a concert when our coachman was too drunk to drive safely.

At a ball, Mr. Uxbridge confessed that he had fallen in love with me, and though I was overwhelmed, I felt something deep for him too. Our relationship grew, and soon he asked to marry me.

Aunt Eliza told me that if she won the lawsuit, I would be rich, but if not, I would remain as I was. In March, we learned that Aunt Eliza had lost the lawsuit, but it didn’t matter to me. I was happy with Mr. Uxbridge, and we planned to marry in November.

The winter passed with him visiting me every weekend, and in spring, Aunt Eliza sent news that Lemorne had finally been defeated. Despite the lawsuit's outcome, I was content, knowing I had found happiness with Mr. Uxbridge.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the protagonist's relationship with her Aunt Eliza and the implications of Aunt Eliza's lawsuit against the Uxbridge family. The protagonist is caught between her obligation to assist her ailing and wealthy aunt, who represents a potential for financial security, and her developing romantic relationship with Mr. Edward Uxbridge, who is connected to the opposing side in the lawsuit.

This conflict is both external, involving the lawsuit and the families' legal battle over valuable land, and internal, involving the protagonist's feelings and priorities. She navigates the tension between her family's expectations for financial gain through Aunt Eliza and her own desires for personal happiness and love with Mr. Uxbridge, despite his family's role as adversaries in the lawsuit.

Ultimately, the resolution of the lawsuit becomes less significant to her personal happiness, as she finds fulfillment in her relationship with Mr. Uxbridge.

074.txt,"A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble!

The visiphone chimed just as Peri was getting into her dinner gown. She took it off again and threw on a casual bathrobe: a see-through one that had cost the president of Antarctic Enterprise—or maybe it was the chairman of the board—several thousand dollars. She pulled a lock of her lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked in the mirror, made it a bit messier, and wrapped the robe loosely on top and tight around the hips.

After all, some of the men who had her private number were important.

She walked over to the phone and pressed Accept. ""Hello-o, there,"" she said automatically. ""Sorry to keep you waiting. I was just taking a bath and—Oh. It's you.""

Gus Doran's eyes widened at her. ""Wow,"" he whispered. ""You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?""

""Well, hurry up with whatever it is,"" snapped Peri. ""I've got a date tonight.""

""I'll say you do! With a Martian!""

Peri narrowed her silver-blue eyes and looked coldly at him. ""You must have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc., that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can just forget it. I saw him first!""

Doran's thin sharp face grinned. ""Break that date, Peri. Put it off or something. I got this Martian for you, see?""

""So? Since when does all of Mars have as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap—""

""Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl, even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight, see? This Martian is really out of it. He's here on official business, but he's a total yokel. Like he asked me what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here's the big thing, Peri, kid.""

Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. ""He's got a hundred million dollars expense money, and they aren't going to check his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates, legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he's about as confident as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I didn't know better, I'd say this will be like taking candy from a baby.""

Peri's peaches-and-cream face started to look like peaches and cream left out overnight on Pluto. ""Badger?"" she asked.

""Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the setup. I'll be the go-between, so he'll still think of me as his friend, because I have other plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this one night's work, something's wrong. And your share of a million is three hundred thirty-three—""

""Is five hundred thousand flat,"" said Peri. ""Too bad I just got an awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where are you, Gus?""

The gravity wasn't as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected. Three generations on Mars might make the legs longer and the chest a bit bigger, but the genes came from Earth and people adjust. What made him gasp was the air. It felt like a ton of wool and seemed to have soaked up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears used to listening through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the noise carried by Earth's. The passport official seemed to shout at him.

""Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat from your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.""

""Well—recruiting.""

The official patted his comfortable stomach, shiny in his uniform, and chuckled kindly. ""I'm afraid, sir, you won't find many people who want to leave. They wouldn't be able to watch the Teamsters Hour on Mars, would they?""

""Oh, we don't expect immigration,"" said Matheny shyly. He was fairly young, but small, with a head that seemed too big for his slender body. ""We learned a long time ago that no one is interested anymore in giving up even second-class citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we just wanted to hire—uh, I mean engage—an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We know our export trade doesn't have a chance among all your corporations unless we get some—a five-year contract...?""

He heard his words trailing off into nothing and cursed himself.

""Well, good luck."" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the passport and handed it back. ""There, now, you are free to travel anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the capital and get into the sticks—um, I mean the provinces. I'm sure there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you can attract anyone out of Newer York.""

""Thanks,"" said Matheny, ""but, you see, I—we need—that is.... Oh, well. Thanks. Good-bye.""

He backed out of the office.

A dropshaft put him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, pushed him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a hundred feet down at the river of cars. Phobos! he thought wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin before I hit the pavement!

The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He couldn't see stars or even the moon through the city's lights. The forest of colorful towers, stretching half a mile into the sky over more land than he could see, was impressive and all that, but—he used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a pipe under the stars. On summer evenings, that is, when the temperature wasn't too far below zero.

Why did they pick me for this job? he asked himself in a rush of homesickness. What the heck is the Martian Embassy here for?

He, Peter Matheny, was just a peaceful professor of sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised his government before now—in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his idea—but still he was comfortable only with his books and his chess and his rock collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an occasional trip to Swindletown—

My God, thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm supposed to find my planet a con man!

He began walking, disheartened, at random. His lizardskin shirt and black culottes drew glances, but mocking ones: their cut was forty years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought gloomily, but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would send his baggage to him whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before Mars had such machines. If ever.

The city roared at him.

He fumbled after his pipe. Of course, he told himself, that's why the Embassy can't act. I may find it necessary to go outside the law. Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld?

He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the adventurous individualism which that document summed up, the article was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts, without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge to figure out the system by which the management operated a wheel. Yet more, he would have been among people he understood.

The frightening thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding his wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a chance against, say, the Grant, Harding & Adams Public Relations Agency.

Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any individual sign through all that flickering neon. His eye fell on one that was distinguished by being less flashy.

THE CHURCH OF CHOICE _Enter, Play, Pray_

That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.

""Ah, brother, welcome,"" said a red-haired usherette in demure black leotards. ""The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The restaurant is right up those stairs.""

""I—I'm not hungry,"" stammered Matheny. ""I just wanted to sit in—""

""To your left, sir.""

The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, endless.

""Get your chips right here, sir,"" said the girl in the booth.

""Hm?"" said Matheny.

She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games. He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.

He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off. But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been switched on him.

""I say!"" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the green table. ""I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.""

""You did all right, brother,"" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously surgical bodice.

""But—I mean—when do we start actually playing? What happened to the cocked dice?""

The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. ""Sir! This is a church!""

""Oh—I see—excuse me, I, I, I—"" Matheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.

""You forgot your chips, pal,"" said a voice.

""Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is—"" Matheny cursed his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?

The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak and curly-toed slippers.

""You're from Mars, aren't you?"" he asked in the friendliest tone Matheny had yet heard.

""Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I—"" He stuck out his hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. ""Damn! Oh, excuse me, I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.""

""Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.""

Matheny sighed. ""A drink is what I need the very most.""

""My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.""

They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what remained of his winnings.

""I don't want to—I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran—""

""Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met a Martian. I am very interested.""

""There aren't many of us on Earth,"" agreed Matheny. ""Just a small embassy staff and an occasional like me.""

""I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother planet and so on.""

""We can't afford it,"" said Matheny. ""What with gravitation and distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage."" As they entered the shaft, he added wistfully: ""You Earth people have that kind of money, at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few tourists to us?""

""I always wanted to,"" said Doran. ""I would like to see the what they call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!"" He winked and nudged.

""Oh,"" said Matheny.

He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to deserve—

""Of course,"" Matheny said ritually, ""I agree with all the archeologists it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.""

""Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,"" said Doran. ""I mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.""

""I do know,"" said Matheny. ""But we're poor—a handful of people trying to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment and supplies—which can only be paid for in Earth dollars—and we can't export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.""

By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.

""Whassa matter?"" asked Doran. ""Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic technician before?""

""Uh, yes, but—well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.""

Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.

""What'll you have?"" asked Doran. ""It's on me.""

""Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean—""

""Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?""

Matheny shuddered. ""Good Lord, no!""

""Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?""

""Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean—well, I imagine it doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.""

""Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!"" Doran's face split in a grin. ""You know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!"" He raised a hand. ""Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices, why do you call yourselves poor?""

""Because we are,"" said Matheny. ""By the time the shipping costs have been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage, and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate Earth taxes—there's very little profit going back to the distillery on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.""

""Have you not got some other business?""

""Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only one has been really successful—I Was a Slave Girl on Mars.

""Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one. Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around—you know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars—but expressed absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.""

""How about postage stamps?"" inquired Doran. ""Philately is a big business, I have heard.""

""It was our mainstay,"" admitted Matheny, ""but it's been overworked. Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.""

Doran whistled. ""I got to give your people credit for enterprise, anyway!"" He fingered his mustache. ""Uh, pardon me, but have you tried to, well, attract capital from Earth?""

""Of course,"" said Matheny bitterly. ""We offer the most liberal concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport firm or—or anybody—who wanted to come and actually invest a few dollars in Mars—why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one. But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of liberties to the incorporated state—what could General Nucleonics hope to get from Mars?""

""I see. Well, what are you having to drink?""

""Beer,"" said Matheny without hesitation.

""Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.""

""The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary freight charges tacked on,"" said Matheny. ""Heineken's!""

Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.

""This is a real interesting talk, Pete,"" he said. ""You are being very frank with me. I like a man that is frank.""

Matheny shrugged. ""I haven't told you anything that isn't known to every economist.""

Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough.

The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the Martian.

""Ahhh!"" said Matheny. ""Bless you, my friend.""

""A pleasure.""

""But now you must let me buy you one.""

""That is not necessary. After all,"" said Doran with great tact, ""with the situation as you have been describing—""

""Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will entertain quite a bit.""

Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. ""You're here on business, then?""

""Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business manager for the Martian export trade.""

""What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault there are so many rackets—uh, taxes—and middlemen and agencies and et cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.""

Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama top. ""Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and how to dodge the tax bite and—and—well, you see how it goes, that sort of, uh, thing.""

Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second bottle of beer.

""But where do I start?"" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote him anew. ""I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get to see—""

""It might be arranged,"" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. ""It just might. How much could you pay this fellow?""

""A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's Earth years, mind you.""

""I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,"" said Doran, ""but while that is not bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars permanently.""

""I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,"" said Matheny. ""That is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses and, well ... let me buy you a drink!""

Doran's black eyes frogged at him. ""You might at that,"" said the Earthman very softly. ""Yes, you might at that.""

Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange some contacts....

""No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.""

A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a big-city taste like his.

""What I really want,"" said Matheny, ""what I really want—I mean what Mars really needs, get me?—is a confidence man.""

""A what?""

""The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game for us and make us some real money.""

""Con man? Oh. A slipstring.""

""A con by any other name,"" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit.

Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. ""You are interesting me strangely, my friend. Say on.""

""No."" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an odd quality.

""No, sorry, Gus,"" he said. ""I spoke too much.""

""Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.""

""By all means."" Matheny disposed of his last beer. ""I could use some gaiety.""

""You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room first and some more up-to-date clothes.""

""Allez,"" said Matheny. ""If I don't mean allons, or maybe alors.""

The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.

Oh, well, he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will quibble.

And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to show the vertical incandescence of the towers.

""Whoof!"" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his contours. He jumped. ""What the dusty hell—Oh."" He tried to grin, but his face burned. ""I see.""

""That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,"" agreed Doran. He lowered himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a cigarette. ""Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around 2100 hours earliest.""

""What?""

""You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.""

""Me?"" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. ""Me? Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is—"" His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened uncertain lips.

""You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an abandoned canal.""

""What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate—""

""Look, Pete,"" said Doran patiently. ""She don't have to know that, does she?""

""Well—well, no. I guess not No.""

""Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,"" said Doran. ""I recommend you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.""

While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.

""You said one thing, Pete,"" Doran remarked. ""About needing a slipstring. A con man, you would call it.""

""Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.""

""Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And maybe I have got a few contacts.""

""What?"" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.

Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him. ""I am not that man,"" he said frankly. ""But in my line I get a lot of contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if, say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you a phone number.""

He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. ""Sure, you may not be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have got to think positively.""

Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe he became overcautious.

They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.

""I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,"" he said slowly. ""But it would have to be under security.""

""Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.""

""What? But—but—"" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.

In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in. Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an instant's hesitation.

""I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,"" he recited. Then, cheerfully: ""And that formula, Pete, happens to be the honest-to-zebra truth.""

""I know."" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. ""I'm sorry to—to—I mean of course I trust you, but—""

""Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work. Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure, I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange—Go ahead, boy, go ahead."" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.

""Oh, it's simple enough,"" said Matheny. ""It's only that we already are operating con games.""

""On Mars, you mean?""

""Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been manufacturing relics ever since.""

""Huh? Well, why, but—""

""In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary haul,"" said Matheny. ""Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars and they depend on our people to—Well, anyhow—""

""I will be clopped! Good for you!""

Doran blew up in laughter. ""That is one thing I would never spill, even without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?""

""Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,"" said Matheny apologetically. ""She was another official project.""

""Who?""

""Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected Earth coins.""

""Oh, that. Sure, I remember—Hey! You didn't!""

""Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.""

""I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?""

""Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister."" Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his back. ""There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.""

""Uh!"" exclaimed Doran.

""And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads. 'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available to a select few—' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.""

He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who had heard everything already.

Doran whistled.

""That's about all, so far,"" confessed Matheny. ""Perhaps a con is our only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but—well, I don't know.""

""I think—"" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.

""Yes?"" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.

""I may be able to find the man you want,"" said Doran. ""I just may. It will take a few days and might get a little expensive.""

""You mean.... Mr. Doran—Gus—you could actually—""

""I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I know. We deserve a celebration!""

Peri was tall. Peri was slim. Peri smoldered when she walked and exploded when she stretched. Her apartment was ivory and ebony, her sea-green dress was poured on, and the Neo-Sino mode had obviously been engineered to her personal specifications.

She waved twelve inches of jade cigarette holder, lifted her glass and murmured throatily: ""To you, Pete. To Mars.""

""I, I, I,"" stammered Matheny. He raised his own glass. It slopped over. ""Oh, damn! I mean ... gosh, I'm so sorry, I—""

""No harm done. You aren't used to our gravity yet."" Peri extended a flawless leg out of her slit skirt and turned it about on the couch, presumably in search of a more comfortable position. ""And it must seem terribly cramped here on Earth, Pete,"" she continued. ""After roaming the desert, hunting, sleeping under the twin moons. Two moons! Why, what girl could resist that?""

""Uh, well, as a matter of fact, the moons are barely visible,"" floundered Matheny.

""Must you spoil my dreams?"" she said. ""When I think of Mars, the frontier, where men are still men, why, my breast swells with emotion.""

""Uh, yes."" Matheny gulped. ""Swell. Yes.""

She leaned closer to his chair. ""Now that I've got you, don't think you'll get away,"" she smiled. ""A live Martian, trapped!""

Doran looked at his watch. ""Well,"" he said, ""I have got to get up tomorrow, so I had better run along now.""

""Ta-ta,"" said Peri. Matheny rose. She pulled him down beside her. ""Oh, no, you don't, Mars lad. I'm not through with you yet!""

""But, but, but,"" said Matheny.

Doran chuckled. ""I'll meet you on the Terrace at fourteen hundred hours tomorrow,"" he said. ""Have fun, Pete.""

The door closed on him.

Peri slithered toward her guest. He felt a nudge and looked down. She had not actually touched him with her hands. ""Gus is a good squiff,"" she said, ""but I wondered if he'd ever go.""

""Why, why ... what do you mean?"" croaked Matheny.

""Haven't you guessed?""

She kissed him. It was rather like being caught in a nuclear turbine with soft blades.

Matheny, said Matheny, you represent your planet.

Matheny, said Matheny, shut up.

Time passed.

""Have another drink,"" said Peri, ""while I slip into something more comfortable.""

Her idea of comfort was modest in one sense of the word: a nightdress or something, like a breath of smoke, and a seat on Matheny's lap.

""If you kiss me like that just once more,"" she breathed, ""I'll forget I'm a nice girl.""

Matheny kissed her like that.

The door crashed open. A large man stood there, breathing heavily. ""What are you doing with my wife?"" he bawled.

""Sam!"" screamed Peri. ""I thought you were in Australia!""

""And he said he might settle out of court,"" finished Matheny. He stared in a numb fashion at his beer. ""He'll come to my hotel room this afternoon. What am I going to do?""

""It is a great shame,"" said Doran. ""I never thought.... You know, he told everybody he would be gone on business for weeks yet. Pete, I am more sorry than I can express.""

""If he thinks I'll pay his miserable blackmail,"" bristled Matheny, ""he can take his head and stick—""

Doran shook his own. ""I am sorry, Pete, but I would pay if I was you. He does have a case. It is too bad he just happened to be carrying that loaded camera, but he is a photographer and our laws on Earth are pretty strict about unlicensed correspondents. You could be very heavily fined as well as deported, plus all the civil-damage claims and the publicity. It would ruin your mission and even make trouble for the next man Mars sent.""

""But,"" stuttered Matheny, ""b-but it's a badger game!""

""Look,"" said Doran. He leaned over the table and gripped the Martian's shoulder. ""I am your friend, see? I feel real bad this happened. In a way, it is my fault and I want to help you. So let me go talk to Sam Wendt. I will cool him off if I can. I will talk down his figure. It will still cost you, Pete, but you can pad your expense account, can't you? So we will both come see you today. That way there will be two people on your side, you and me, and Sam will not throw his weight around so much. You pay up in cash and it will be the end of the affair. I will see to that, pal!""

Matheny stared at the small dapper man. His aloneness came to him like a blow in the stomach. Et tu, Brute, he thought.

He bit his lip. ""Thanks, Gus,"" he said. ""You are a real friend.""

Sam blocked the doorway with his shoulders as he entered the room. Doran followed like a diminutive tug pushing a very large liner. They closed the door. Matheny stood up, avoiding Sam's glare.

""Okay, louse,"" said Sam. ""You got a better pal here than you deserve, but he ain't managed to talk me into settling for nothing.""

""Let me get this—I mean—well,"" said Matheny. ""Look, sir, you claim that I, I mean that your wife and I were, uh, well, we weren't. I was only visiting—""

""Stow it, stow it."" Sam towered over the Martian. ""Shoot it to the Moon. You had your fun. It'll cost you. One million dollars.""

""One mil—But—but—Gus,"" wailed Matheny, ""this is out of all reason! I thought you said—""

Doran shrugged. ""I am sorry, Pete. I could not get him any farther down. He started asking fifty. You better pay him.""

""No!"" Matheny scuttled behind a chair. ""No, look here! I, Peter Matheny of the Martian Republic, declare you are blackmailing me!""

""I'm asking compensation for damages,"" growled Sam. ""Hand it over or I'll go talk to a lawyer. That ain't blackmail. You got your choice, don't you?""

Matheny wilted. ""Yes.""

""A megabuck isn't so bad, Pete,"" soothed Doran. ""I personally will see that you earn it back in—""

""Oh, never mind."" Tears stood in Matheny's eyes. ""You win."" He took out his checkbook.

""None of that,"" rapped Sam. ""Cash. Now.""

""But you claimed this was a legitimate—""

""You heard me.""

""Well—could I have a receipt?"" begged Matheny.

Sam grinned.

""I just thought I'd ask,"" said Matheny. He opened a drawer and counted out one hundred ten-kilo-buck bills. ""There! And, and, and I hope you choke on it!""

Sam stuffed the money in a pocket and lumbered out.

Doran lingered. ""Look here, Pete,"" he said, ""I will make this up to you. Honest. All you have got to do is trust me.""

""Sure."" Matheny slumped on the bed. ""Not your fault. Let me alone for a while, will you?""

""Listen, I will come back in a few hours and buy you the best dinner in all the Protectorates and—""

""Sure,"" said Matheny. ""Sure.""

Doran left, closing the door with great gentleness.

He returned at 1730, entered, and stopped dead. The floor space was half taken up by a screen and a film projector.

""What happened, Pete?"" he asked uncertainly.

Matheny smiled. ""I took some tourist movies,"" he said. ""Self-developing soundtrack film. Sit down and I'll show you.""

""Well, thanks, but I am not so much for home movies.""

""It won't take long. Please.""

Doran shrugged, found a chair and took out a cigarette. ""You seem pretty well cheered up now,"" he remarked. ""That is a spirit I like to see. You have got to have faith.""

""I'm thinking of a sideline business in live photography,"" said the Martian. ""Get back my losses of today, you know.""

""Well, now, Pete, I like your spirit, like I say. But if you are really interested in making some of that old baroom, and I think you are, then listen—""

""I'll sell prints to people for home viewing,"" went on Matheny. ""I'd like your opinion of this first effort.""

He dimmed the transparency and started the projector. The screen sprang into colored motion. Sam Wendt blocked the doorway with his shoulders.

""Who knows, I might even sell you one of the several prints I made today,"" said Matheny.

""Okay, louse,"" said Sam.

""Life is hard on Mars,"" commented Matheny in an idle tone, ""and we're an individualistic culture. The result is pretty fierce competition, though on a person-to-person rather than organizational basis. All friendly enough, but—Oh, by the way, how do you like our Martian camera technology? I wore this one inside my buttonhole.""

Doran in the screen shrugged and said: ""I am sorry, Pete."" Doran in the chair stubbed out his cigarette, very carefully, and asked, ""How much do you want for that film?""

""Would a megabuck be a fair price?"" inquired Matheny.

""Uh ... huh.""

""Of course, I am hoping Sam will want a copy too.""

Doran swallowed. ""Yeah. Yes, I think I can talk him into it.""

""Good."" Matheny stopped the projector. He sat down on the edge of the table, swinging one leg, and lit his pipe. Its bowl glowed in the dimness like the eye of a small demon. ""By the way,"" he said irrelevantly, ""if you check the newscast tapes, you'll find I was runner-up in last year's all-Martian pistol contest. It's a tough contest to win. There are no bad shots on Mars—survival of the fittest, you know.""

Doran wet his lips. ""Uh, no hard feelings. No, none at all. But say, in case you are, well, you know, looking for a slipstring, what I came here for was to tell you I have located the very guy you want. Only he is in jail right now, see, and it will cost—""

""Oh, no!"" groaned Matheny. ""Not the Syrtis Prospector! Kids are taught that swindle in kindergarten.""

Doran bowed his head. ""We call it the Spanish Prisoner here,"" he said. He got up. ""I will send the price of those films around in the morning.""

""You'll call your bank and have the cash pneumoed here tonight,"" said Matheny. ""Also Sam's share. I daresay he can pay you back.""

""No harm in trying, was there?"" asked Doran humbly.

""None at all."" Matheny chuckled. ""In fact, I'm grateful to you. You helped me solve my major problem.""

""Huh? I did what? How?""

""I'll have to investigate further, but I'm sure my hunch will be confirmed. You see, we Martians have stood in awe of Earthmen. And since for a long time there's been very little contact between the two planets except the purely official, impersonal sort, there's been nothing to disabuse us. It's certainly true that our organizations can't compete with yours, because your whole society is based on organizations. But now, by the same token, I wonder if your individuals can match ours. Ever hear of the Third Moon? No? The whipsaw play? The aqueduct squeeze? Good Lord, can't you even load a derrel set?""

Matheny licked his chops. ""So there's our Martian export to Earth. Martian con men. I tell you this under security, of course—not that anyone would believe you, till our boys walk home with the shirt off the Terrestrial back.""

He waved an imperious pipe-stem. ""Hurry up and pay me, please. I've a date tonight with Peri. I just called her up and explained the situation and she really does seem to like Martians.""

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK INNOCENT AT LARGE ***

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Innocent At Large, by Poul Anderson and Karen Anderson",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story ""Innocent At Large"" revolves around Peter Matheny, a naive Martian, trying to navigate the complexities and deceit of Earth's society. Matheny's mission is to hire a business manager to help Mars improve its export trade. However, being unfamiliar with Earth's social dynamics and underworld, he becomes entangled in a badger game orchestrated by Gus Doran and his accomplices, Peri and Sam Wendt, who aim to exploit his naivety for financial gain.

The dilemma Matheny faces is twofold: if he avoids trouble, he risks failing his mission to secure Mars' economic future; if he gets into trouble, he must find a way to extricate himself without causing a diplomatic incident or financial ruin. Throughout the story, Matheny's challenge is to balance his mission's objectives with his personal survival in a world that is foreign and hostile to his straightforward Martian sensibilities. The resolution comes when Matheny turns the tables on his would-be exploiters, revealing that he is not as naive as they thought, and in doing so, identifies a potential new export for Mars: Martian con men who could outwit Earth's individuals.",Imagine landing on Earth with $100 million and realizing everyone wants a piece of it.

075.txt,"The doctor's office was shiny and modern. Behind the desk, the doctor smiled at James Wheatley through his thick glasses. ""Now, then! What seems to be the trouble?""

Wheatley had been nervous for five days about coming here. ""I know it's silly,"" he said. ""But I've been having a pain in my toe.""

""Indeed!"" said the doctor. ""Well, now! How long have you had this pain, my man?""

""About six months now, I'd say. Just now and then, you know. It's never really been bad. Until last week. You see—""

""I see,"" said the doctor. ""Getting worse all the time, you say.""

Wheatley wiggled his painful toe thoughtfully. ""Well—you might say that. You see, when I first—""

""How old did you say you were, Mr. Wheatley?""

""Fifty-five.""

""Fifty-_five_!"" The doctor looked through the medical record on his desk. ""But this is incredible. You haven't had a checkup in almost ten years!""

""I guess I haven't,"" said Wheatley, apologetically. ""I'd been feeling pretty well until—""

""_Feeling_ well!"" The doctor stared in shock. ""But my dear fellow, no checkup since January 1963! We aren't in the Middle Ages, you know. This is 1972.""

""Well, of course—""

""Of course you may be _feeling_ well enough, but that doesn't mean everything is just the way it should be. And now, you see, you're having pains in your toes!""

""One toe,"" said Wheatley. ""The little one on the right. It seemed to me—""

""One toe _today_, perhaps,"" said the doctor seriously. ""But _tomorrow_—"" He sighed. ""How about your breathing lately? Been getting short of breath when you hurry upstairs?""

""Well—I _have_ been bothered a little.""

""I thought so! Does your heart pound when you run for the subway? Feel tired all day? Pains in your calves when you walk fast?""

""Uh—yes, occasionally, I—"" Wheatley looked worried and rubbed his toe on the chair leg.

""You know that fifty-five is a dangerous age,"" said the doctor gravely. ""Do you have a cough? Heartburn after dinner? Prop up on pillows at night? Just as I thought! And no checkup for ten years!"" He sighed again.

""I suppose I should have seen to it,"" Wheatley admitted. ""But you see, it's just that my toe—""

""My dear fellow! Your toe is _part_ of you. It doesn't just exist down there all by itself. If your _toe_ hurts, there must be a _reason_.""

Wheatley looked more worried than ever. ""There must? I thought—perhaps you could just give me a little something—""

""To stop the pain?"" The doctor looked shocked. ""Well, of course I could _do_ that, but that's not getting at the root of the trouble, is it? That's just treating symptoms. Medieval quackery. Medicine has advanced a long way since your last checkup, my friend. And even treatment has its dangers. Did you know that more people died last year of _aspirin_ poisoning than of _cyanide_ poisoning?""

Wheatley wiped his forehead. ""I—dear me! I never realized—""

""We have to _think_ about those things,"" said the doctor. ""Now, the problem here is to find out _why_ you have the pain in your toe. It could be inflammatory. Maybe a tumor. Perhaps it could be, uh, functional ... or maybe vascular!""

""Perhaps you could take my blood pressure, or something,"" Wheatley offered.

""Well, of course I _could_. But that isn't really my field, you know. It wouldn't really _mean_ anything, if I did it. But there's nothing to worry about. We have a fine Hypertensive man at the Diagnostic Clinic."" The doctor checked the appointment book on his desk. ""Now, if we could see you there next Monday morning at nine—""

* * *

""Very interesting X-rays,"" said the young doctor with the red hair. ""_Very_ interesting. See this shadow in the duodenal cap? See the prolonged emptying time? And I've never seen such beautiful pylorospasm!""

""This is my toe?"" asked Wheatley, moving closer to the doctors. It seemed he had been waiting for a very long time.

""Toe! Oh, no,"" said the red-headed doctor. ""No, that's the Orthopedic Radiologist's job. I'm a Gastro-Intestinal man, myself. Upper. Dr. Schultz here is Lower."" The red-headed doctor turned back to his consultation with Dr. Schultz. Mr. Wheatley rubbed his toe and waited.

Soon, another doctor came by. He looked very serious as he sat down beside Wheatley. ""Tell me, Mr. Wheatley, have you had an orthodiagram recently?""

""No.""

""An EKG?""

""No.""

""Fluoroaortogram?""

""I—don't _think_ so.""

The doctor looked even more serious and walked away, muttering to himself. In a few moments, he came back with two more doctors. ""—no question in _my_ mind that it's cardiomegaly,"" he was saying, ""but Haddonfield should know. He's the best Left Ventricle man in the city. Excellent paper in the AMA Journal last July: 'The Inadequacies of Modern Orthodiagramatic Techniques in Demonstrating Minimal Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.' A brilliant study, simply brilliant! Now _this_ patient—"" He glanced toward Wheatley, and his voice dropped to a mumble.

Soon two of the men nodded, and one walked over to Wheatley, cautiously, as though afraid he might suddenly disappear. ""Now, there's nothing to be worried about, Mr. Wheatley,"" he said. ""We're going to have you fixed up in just no time at all. Just a few more studies. Now, if you could see me in Valve Clinic tomorrow afternoon at three—""

Wheatley nodded. ""Nothing serious, I hope?""

""Serious? Oh, no! Dear me, you _mustn't_ worry. Everything is going to be all right,"" the doctor said.

""Well—I—that is, my toe is still bothering me some. It's not nearly as bad, but I wondered if maybe you—""

Dawn broke on the doctor's face. ""Give you something for it? Well now, we aren't Therapeutic men, you understand. Always best to let the expert handle the problem in his own field."" He paused, stroking his chin for a moment. ""Tell you what we'll do. Dr. Epstein is one of the finest Therapeutic men in the city. He could take care of you in a jiffy. We'll see if we can't arrange an appointment with him after you've seen me tomorrow.""

Mr. Wheatley was late to Mitral Valve Clinic the next day because he had gone to Aortic Valve Clinic by mistake, but finally he found the right waiting room. A few hours later he was being thumped, photographed, and listened to. Substances were popped into his right arm, and withdrawn from his left arm as he marveled at the brilliance of modern medical techniques. Before they were finished he had been seen by both the Mitral men and the Aortic men, as well as the Great Arteries man and the Peripheral Capillary Bed man.

The Therapeutic man happened to be in Atlantic City at a convention and the Rheumatologist was on vacation, so Wheatley was sent to Functional Clinic instead. ""Always have to rule out these things,"" the doctors agreed. ""Wouldn't do much good to give you medicine if your trouble isn't organic, now, would it?"" The Psychoneuroticist studied his sex life, while the Psychosociologist examined his social surroundings. Then they talked for a long time.

Three days later he was waiting in the hallway downstairs again. Heads met in a group; words and phrases slipped out from time to time as the discussion grew heated.

""—no doubt in my mind that it's a—""

""But we can't ignore the endocrine implications, doctor—""

""You're perfectly right there, of course. Bittenbender at the University might be able to answer the question. No better Pituitary Osmoreceptorologist in the city—""

""—a Tubular Function man should look at those kidneys first. He's fifty-five, you know.""

""—has anyone studied his filtration fraction?""

""—might be a peripheral vascular spasticity factor—""

After a while, James Wheatley got up from the bench and slipped out the door, limping slightly as he went.

* * *

The room was small and dimly lit, with heavy Turkish drapes hiding the dark hallway beyond. A hint of incense hung in the air.

Soon, a thin, dark-skinned man with a mustache and turban appeared through the curtains and bowed solemnly. ""You come with a problem?"" he asked, with a slight accent.

""As a matter of fact, yes,"" James Wheatley said hesitantly. ""You see, I've been having a pain in my right little toe....""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around James Wheatley's struggle to receive effective and straightforward medical treatment for his simple complaint—a pain in his little toe. Despite his clear and simple symptom, he becomes entangled in the complexities and inefficiencies of the modern medical system. 

The dilemma highlights the contrast between the advancements in medical science and the lack of personalized care. Wheatley is shuffled between numerous specialists, each focusing on their specific field of expertise, which leads to an overwhelming and confusing experience without addressing his actual concern. This situation exemplifies the irony and frustration of seeking medical help, where the system's complexity obscures the patient's simple need for relief.

Ultimately, Wheatley's decision to leave the conventional medical system and seek a solution from a traditional healer suggests his desperation and loss of faith in modern medicine's ability to address his immediate problem.

They were the only ones like them to grow up and thrive.

I was their first and best student, and the last time I was with them, I had a sudden idea to write down what they told me using a special shorthand we created.

---

Kitten, it’s hard to believe that three successful years of work could end with us hiding in a ditch or predicting a bullet from those we thought were friends. People are so complex. They seem to be born with complications that only grow as they do. It’s no wonder they’ve struggled for so long, trying to balance ethics and emotions.

Here we are, meant to be a bridge to a new world for humanity, stuck in the mud instead of celebrating the wonders of the mind. If only we could make them see! Maybe our teachers were right; we should have stayed under the university’s protection instead of going out on our own.

Princess, do you remember Lucille? She was the best student after you. She made a mistake by bringing someone new to us without asking first. It wasn’t all her fault, though. We lost our control. People do silly things when they think they’re in love. Maybe we wanted to spare her some embarrassment.

You were away when he showed up. He was the man Lucille brought as a potential student. One side of them is closing in on us now, Kitten. We need to try to reach the swamp ahead to lose them for a while. Our own people aren’t really trying to hit us. They’re good shots but are just putting on a show. The ones to worry about are Thurlow and his deputy, Trainor.

The sheriff saw us and started moving in, but he’s a good guy. I hope he doesn’t get in trouble because of us.

Finally! If this swampy patch is as thick as we think, we’re safe, as long as the state troopers don’t take over. Our sheriff is still in charge. If only we weren’t so tired!

Lucy brought Thurlow in, and we treated him like the others. We went too far and scared him. We told him what he had for breakfast, guessed the contents of his wallet, and levitated it into his hand. It was a mistake, especially since he was sensitive but hard to read. He could have been great with training.

He was amazed but also scared. It was beyond his experience, and he was superstitious despite his education. Some people let prejudice stop them from learning new things.

He said things that showed his true feelings. His mind wasn’t pretty. It made us sick and gave us headaches. Later, we followed him but couldn’t read him because of his anger.

He thought what we were doing was impossible in 1983. He called it black magic and refused to listen to reason. He didn’t understand that everyone has these abilities inside them. Our diplomas and degrees meant nothing to him. The more he talked, the angrier he got, ranting about tampering with things better left alone. It would have been funny if it wasn't so serious.

When he accused us of corrupting children’s minds, he stormed out of the office, warning us we hadn’t heard the last of him.

Lucy was upset. We didn’t need to tell her what the meeting meant. We also didn’t tell her what else we saw in Thurlow’s wallet. She found out while we were trying to teach her, interrupted by a call from Casey at the sheriff's office. Thurlow was a district judge, a high-ranking law official.

Casey overheard Thurlow complaining to the sheriff, who politely but firmly told him we were valuable for interrogating tough suspects, and since we hadn't committed any crimes, there was nothing to be done. Especially since the judge was out of his district! We were in District One, under Judge Kimball.

Kimball was recovering from a heart attack and couldn’t take the bench. Casey thought District One might need a temporary judge, but that didn’t happen.

Swamp water is cold, Princess, even in summer. We’re shivering and hungry. It's what happens when you let fear take over. We haven’t been very smart about it. Another thing to learn from.

After Casey's call, we focused on our work again, studying the mind. Only the ringing phone brought us back. It’s too bad we had to talk to most people that way. It’s slow, and they could learn so easily.

Casey called to say we were needed at the station. He didn’t know why. Thinking it was another tough suspect, we headed down. The sheriff seemed puzzled and troubled. We could read that much, but his thoughts were a jumble. All he knew was we were wanted in the judge’s chambers.

You guessed it, Honey. Judge Thurlow was filling in for Kimball and decided to give us a talking to. He saw it as his duty to the community. Trainor was busy signing something when we walked in. It felt wrong seeing Thurlow at Kimball’s desk. The room no longer felt friendly.

Thurlow was full of self-righteous anger, vowing to fight us to the end—and now we're in this ditch. The water was freezing.

Trainor was signing a complaint about our teaching methods, not covered by our license. Thurlow confirmed this and signed a restraining order forbidding us from teaching. We couldn’t fight it; he was the highest authority unless we went to the Supreme Court, and public opinion was against us.

The sheriff and his men supported us emotionally, but legally they had to follow the judge's orders. If we ignored the order, we’d be jailed.

We had no witnesses for a court case, and we didn’t want to involve our students or former university teachers. It was unfair to drag them into a legal battle.

So we decided to go underground. It felt like the dark ages when knowledge had to hide. We couldn’t waste our gifts after developing them so much. We had to share what we learned.

If only we hadn’t been so sheltered at the university. We didn’t know what to do about the hunger that was wearing us down. We were just skin and bones. Donald felt it the most. We must support each other and pray we don’t get too weak. We haven’t eaten in almost 24 hours. We didn’t have time for breakfast. Our clothes are drying, but it’s still cold enough to catch a cold.

We thought we picked a good hiding place, but we underestimated Trainor. He's smart and determined. He found us in five days and had enough proof to report to Thurlow and come after us with an arrest warrant. We couldn’t stall or dodge him, being inexperienced with people and police tactics. We’re twenty-six but have the experience of a three-year-old. We’d do better if we had another chance.

There was no use fighting. The state was behind him. We went quietly to see Thurlow, who fined us for contempt of court. We couldn’t pay, so we had to stay in jail for eight months and ten days, with possible time off for good behavior.

The sheriff was sad to have us as guests. Maybe he realized how unfair Thurlow’s actions were.

Donald called Judge Kimball, who was still weak but concerned. He couldn’t help us, though. Thurlow was the law in his absence.

We looked at the jail from the inside. The walls seemed grayer.

I hope we’re not boring you, Kitten, but someone should know the full story. You missed a lot after we closed the school, so consider this filling you in. Maybe someday it’ll be useful—if we get out of this mess.

The state police have taken over, and our sheriff is just watching. It’s too bad we’re not in his territory. Things might be better.

The troopers are efficient. Donald senses them closing in. We can only head through the swamp now. Trainor and Thurlow are with them. Thurlow’s presence gives us a tiny jab of pain. That impossible man!

Our students stopped coming, thinking the school was closed, until you visited and spread the word that discreet visits were allowed. Only a few returned, but those who did learned and grew quickly. They realized their responsibility and accepted it eagerly.

But it couldn’t last. Trainor’s turn on the afternoon shift gave him plenty of time to watch us. We were cautious but couldn’t know what he was looking for because he didn’t know either. He found out one afternoon. Visitors don’t just sit around staring.

We learned that trained men don’t always consciously think things out. Their reactions become instinctive, so we couldn’t trace them telepathically. We knew he was spying, but that’s all.

The result was a direct order from Thurlow cutting off all visitors and canceling our good behavior days. That was five days a month, and it was hard to bear. The injustice was getting to us.

The final blow was news from Judge Kimball’s court reporter. Kimball was so upset by our treatment that he got out of bed too soon and died. We lost a dear friend and any chance of his help. Thurlow would preside over District One until the election. We were on our own.

We decided to return to the university after our sentence and teach under its protection. We’d join the faculty, and the trouble would pass.

How we spent the rest of our jail time is unimportant. We learned more about our gifts and how powerful they could be if people realized their potential. They could even find happiness.

Finally, we were free. It was raining, but the world seemed bright. We reached for the phone to call the university, but Trainor handed us a restraining order.

After that, we tried to find work but failed. Being different is a heavy burden. No one cared that we had feelings or got hungry and thirsty without money.

Hunger and thirst. As if we needed a reminder. Donald is getting weaker. We certainly have no—

I interrupt here, as I lost telepathic contact with them. I prayed for their safety. I knew what a dreary world it would be without them.

That was a bad half hour, Puss. The troopers are so well trained they’re hard to sense telepathically. Donald was so weak he let one get close enough for a rifle shot. It missed, but it revealed our location. Donald found we had time to deal with the trooper if we hurried. Normally we wouldn’t stand a chance, but desperation can do wonders. We pretended to surrender, then surprised him. It was a dirty trick, but we couldn’t let him catch us. We left his rifle and ran.

The others hesitated when they found him, giving us more time. We made it across a road to a barn and hid in the hay. We need to rest. We’re not the athletic type.

Our money was running low, and we didn’t know what to do. Then it happened.

We were at the library, and Donald sensed a stack of returned books, hoping to find something new. The stack was mixed, with books on various topics, including one on making things at home.

On the way home, Donald had an idea. Our minds were so tuned that what one sensed, the other knew instantly. It was a great system.

Donald’s idea was brilliant, even though it borrowed from someone else. We’d join a carnival! If a man could hide a letter in plain sight, why not hide with the carnival? It was perfect.

The owner saw our abilities and wondered how little he could offer us. We had some bargaining power, but we just wanted in. We worried about lowering our status, but we didn’t care anymore.

We learned that “status” is just a viewpoint. To outsiders, carnies seem tough and money-hungry. They are tough to outsiders, but inside, there are good people and keen minds.

We felt secure for the first time in a long while. We made friends and gained fame as money-earners for the show. We got a raise after some persuasion. Best of all, we lost ourselves in the show’s activity.

Once we felt safe, we started teaching again, carefully picking students. We gained some and lost others as we traveled, but we usually had about twenty.

We were cautious to avoid past mistakes, but it went well. We made no errors and trained some great students, especially one who became skilled enough to teach and left to settle down with a family. It was good to see our work pay off.

The next season, we were booked near home for the first time in two years.

You know what happened then, Baby. You were the one we contacted. Telepathy is better than a phone, isn’t it?

What you might not know is that contacting you started more trouble. How could we know the train ticket agent was a nosy kind of guy? He wondered why so many people were going to the same place on the same day. People don’t travel far to see a small carnival.

Being a small town, he knew most folks by sight and remembered you used to work for us.

Imagine his excitement at such an event in his dull life. How best to enjoy it? By calling the sheriff, of course. I hope he enjoys the memory.

With our luck, Trainor answered the call and sprang into action. Apparently, Thurlow had run for District One and won, leaving his old territory. It’s hard to believe he did it just in case we returned. No one could be that vindictive, right? Or are we still naïve?

We know Trainor and another man followed the group. When they saw you all meet at a tent, they just had to listen to hear nothing was happening! We were so excited to see each other that we didn’t notice them. Why be careful when no one unfriendly was around?

When Trainor called the judge for permission to arrest us, his emotions reached us, but not soon enough for everyone to escape. It happened so fast that our control broke. We were shocked and angry.

It didn’t take long to deal with the deputies. Desperation and anger helped. We tied them up and left them unconscious. Afterward, we realized how serious things had become. We were in deep trouble again, worse than before. We needed time, lots of it.

Stay hidden while you teach, Kitten. It’s your duty to be careful. You can’t learn or help others if you’re detained. Stay connected with others. Your group will grow if you succeed without being caught.

Don’t end up like us, forced to break the law. We didn’t break it by supposedly teaching evil courses but by ignoring the order, beating up police, and running. Running wasn’t the worst, but it got worse when we took a car that wasn’t ours and crossed the state line. That made it a federal crime. Even if troopers catch us, the FBI will get us first. What a mess, right?

This hay is dry. It smells nice, but it’s dusty. Too bad if nature gives us away with a sneeze. We don’t need her tricks now.

Donald sensed a water trough behind the barn. We must risk it. This thirst is as bad as the hunger.

We drove in a circle and left the car before morning, continuing on foot toward a friend who left the carnival to teach. We hoped to stay there until things cooled down.

We made it, tired and hungry, and got a warm welcome. You’ll never know how good that house felt or how amazing fresh bread smelled. His wife is wonderful.

We got a jolt the next morning before breakfast. The neighbor’s little girl burst in while we were teaching a small class. She was very sensitive, and our combined minds overwhelmed her before we could control it.

Her eyes widened, but Donald saved the moment. He made it her secret and showed her a simple ESP trick. She got it quickly because kids learn fast. Their minds aren’t cluttered with adult thoughts. She was delighted and promised to keep our secret.

But of course, they found out. Parents being what they are, it was foolish to think a child could hide signs of her adventure. They poked and prodded until she told them. It wasn’t her fault. The odds were against her.

They saw her bright eyes and spirit and pried out her story. The mother was sympathetic to us, but the father wasn’t. They knew she wasn’t imagining it because of stories they’d heard about us.

The father ranted about us, while the mother tried to reason with him. He was too scared to listen. He, like many others, feared the unknown. It was unthinkable that we should be free. We didn’t belong with normal people. So he called the judge.

We couldn’t stay, so we ran again.

That’s about it, Princess. We’ve run until we can hardly run anymore. We’re weak, hungry, and sick of the hatred and resistance around us. We don’t blame the police. They’re just doing their job.

Donald senses them closing in. Trainor and the judge are with them. The judge’s hate blocks everything. Donald is getting weaker, but we must move to get water and leave before they find this barn.

---

The story broke again for more than an hour, leaving me in suspense. I knew there was no way to help them. I sensed faint efforts to contact me and once felt a deep sorrow like pain. It was late when they reached out again, weak but clear.

---

It’s hard to focus. The ambulance is bumpy, and the pain is terrible. Looking back, there was no other way for it to end. They were too many and too determined, while we were just us and on the run.

Our weakness showed when we went to the water trough, drank, and stumbled into six waiting state policemen. We were so focused on the swamp men, so tired, that we didn’t sense the danger. It was over for us. They approached, but seeing our state, they put their weapons away and gently took us in hand.

We’re getting weaker. Unconsciousness is near again. Donald has just died quietly. He’s escaped them, but the fight is mine now. It won’t last long. The burden is too much for one. The bright spot is our work has begun. Stay with it, darling, and carry on for us. Know you had all our love.

Goodbye, Princess.

---

Almost exactly one minute later, they arrived at the hospital. I was so numb with grief and sorrow that I didn’t break contact, hoping against hope they, he, would speak once more. He did, unconsciously. Seconds later, the words of two interns drifted through his open mind to mine.

Despite their intentions to use their gifts for the betterment of humanity and to educate others, they face resistance and hostility from those who do not understand or fear their abilities. This conflict is embodied in the antagonism from Judge Thurlow and Trainor, who represent the societal and institutional forces determined to suppress what they perceive as threatening or unnatural.

The group is forced into hiding and becomes fugitives, constantly on the run from authorities who seek to arrest them not for any proven wrongdoing but because of their mere existence and their refusal to conform to societal norms. The story highlights the dilemmas of isolation versus integration and safety versus the moral imperative to share and teach their knowledge. Ultimately, their plight raises questions about the cost of being different in a world that often fears and ostracizes those who deviate from the norm.

077.txt,"The first mission from Earth to Mars didn't find any Martians. Neither did the second. It's not surprising, since there are so few Martians left, but the third mission did find them.

For many years before space travel was possible, people talked and guessed about how to talk to Martians, if they existed. But when the time came, nobody was really ready.

So, they went back to an old trick.

Von Frisch, Riley, and Smith watched as six Martians came closer. They were a bit scared. If they weren't twenty miles away from their spaceship—the G-boat—they might have run away. If they didn't have orders, they might have shot first and asked questions later.

""Sir, this is Von Frisch,"" said the engineer into his helmet microphone, sounding a bit nervous. ""Martians are coming toward us!""

""How are they acting?"" asked Captain Powers back at the G-boat right away.

""They don't seem hostile, sir.""

""Stay where you are, but be careful. What do they look like?""

""They're a lot taller than us, but their bodies are round and not much bigger than a child's. They've got really long legs and arms, and big heads with big eyes and ears.""

""Are they smart? Are they civilized? How do they breathe?""

""Hold on, Captain,"" protested Von Frisch. ""You're going too fast. They've just come up to us. I can't tell if that's fur on them or if they're wearing clothes.""

""Well, try to talk to them!"" exclaimed Powers excitedly.

Von Frisch tried his best. The Martians seemed friendly and interested. Von Frisch tried to communicate in the only way he knew.

While his friends watched curiously, he ignored Captain Powers' questions, squatted down, and drew a right-angled triangle in the red sand. By one side, he drew three marks, and by another side, four.

Then he stepped back and looked at the Martians.

One of the Martians squatted down with its long arms and legs, and with a long finger, drew five lines by the triangle's longest side.

""They understand the Pythagorean theorem, sir!"" exclaimed Von Frisch.

""Great! They probably know some astronomy, then. Keep going.""

Von Frisch hesitated a moment, then erased the triangle. He drew a small circle with rays for the sun. He drew four larger circles around it for the planets and small circles on their edges.

He pointed to the third planet, then to himself, and then to his friends, one by one. Then he pointed at the fourth planet and at the Martians, one by one. Finally, he pointed at the sky.

""We are Earthmen,"" he said. ""You are Martians.""

The problem was, the Earthmen didn't know the things the Martians had were weapons until they used them. They didn’t realize it even then because all three Earthmen were dead.

The Martian hunting party returned from the desert with news of the strange creatures who seemed to come from another world.

""We don't know if they have weapons,"" said the leader of the hunting party. ""But they wanted to harm us, so we killed them all.""

""That is a desperate action,"" said the village leader. ""How were they a threat to us?""

""Foolishly, they told us their plan,"" replied the leader of the hunting party. ""They said they wanted to take over our world and drive us farther from the sun, to the big planet Jupiter.""

""Then you did the right thing,"" said the village leader, blinking his big eyes.

Biggs and Golden were working near the G-boat. Their helmet radios were on a different channel from the exploring team, so they couldn’t hear Captain Powers shouting and getting no response. It was just after sunset, and Biggs was looking into the west.

""We should see it now, but it isn't there,"" said Biggs.

""What isn't there?"" asked Golden.

""Mercury,"" said Biggs, who liked to think he knew a lot about astronomy. ""I guess you can't see it from Mars without a telescope. It's too close to the sun.""

He chuckled.

""If there are any Martians,"" he added, ""I guess they think they live on the third planet. That's funny, isn't it?""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around the miscommunication and misunderstanding between humans and Martians. The Earthmen, despite their best intentions and attempts at peaceful communication, fail to recognize the Martians' actions and intentions accurately. The story highlights the challenges and dangers inherent in first contact scenarios, particularly when cultural and communicative barriers exist.

On one side, the Earthmen are operating under the assumption that they can establish a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the Martians using mathematical and astronomical symbols, believing these to be universal languages. On the other side, the Martians misinterpret the Earthmen's actions as a threat. The Martians perceive the Earthmen's attempt to communicate their origin and purpose as a declaration of hostile intent, leading them to preemptively attack to protect themselves.

The dilemma is further compounded by the Earthmen's lack of preparedness and understanding of Martian culture and communication, as well as their inability to recognize the Martians' weapons until it's too late. This tragic misunderstanding leads to the unnecessary deaths of the Earthmen and illustrates the potential consequences of inadequate communication and assumptions in interactions with unknown cultures.

079.txt,"The day was going terribly, and when the elevator didn't come, it just topped it all off. I had already dealt with a broken egg yolk, a stuck zipper, and a window that wouldn't close. The elevator not showing up was just the cherry on top.

Everyone has bad days, but this was not the day for it. I had finally decided to propose to Linda, something I had been building up the courage to do for months. I called her right after the egg incident and set up a time to meet at her place—10 o'clock sharp. Linda was very punctual, and I knew she expected me to be on time.

Linda worked as an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds are robots that are always on time, and if they're not, it means something bad happened. So, she had a strong thing about being on time. Once, I was five minutes late, and she was so worried she thought I was dead.

And then the elevator didn't come.

Before that, I had managed to keep the little disasters from ruining my mood. Even while eating the messed-up egg or fixing the window, I kept practicing my proposal. I had different ideas: a funny one, a romantic one, and a straightforward one. I thought I might be too nervous and just blurt out, ""Will you marry me?""

I loved Linda more than anything, but I knew she liked her independence. So, I was going to ask for a Non-Permanent, No Progeny marriage, which is what most people did.

I left my apartment at five minutes to ten, thinking I'd have plenty of time to get to her place just thirteen floors down. But the elevator didn't come. I waited, pressed the button again, and nothing. It was now two minutes to ten, and I was starting to panic.

I ran back to my apartment to call Linda and let her know I'd be late, but she'd turned off her phone so we wouldn't be interrupted. I was frantic. I ran back to the elevator and pressed the button again, but it was still not coming. I kicked the door a few times out of frustration, then limped back to my apartment and called the Transit Staff to complain.

After a few tries, I got through to a receptionist who quickly told me the elevator was ""disconnected."" I yelled at her, and she finally explained that there was a spy in the elevator.

I couldn't believe it. A spy in the elevator? Apparently, he was discovered on the 147th floor and got into the elevator to escape. He was controlling it manually, trying to crush anyone who came after him. They might have to wait him out until he ran out of food.

I was shocked. A spy had gotten that far into our building! It made the whole situation outside seem real and dangerous. We were always told that there were dangers outside, but inside, life was normal.

Now, knowing there was a spy in the building made everything feel different. I sat there, thinking about it, until I remembered Linda. I checked my watch—10:15. I ran back to the elevator, hoping it would be working, but it wasn't. Then I saw the door to the stairs.

I hadn't used stairs in years. There were over three thousand steps in the building, but it was only thirteen floors to Linda's. I could do it if the door opened. It did, and I started down.

On the landing between floors, I saw a small door marked ""EMERGENCY ENTRANCE ELEVATOR SHAFT."" I wondered why it wasn't guarded. Then the door opened, and the spy came out with a gun.

He told me not to move or make a sound. He looked ordinary, like anyone else, but he had a gun. He asked me where the stairs went, and I told him down to the ground floor. But then we heard the Army coming up the stairs. He needed a place to hide, so he told me to take him to my apartment.

We walked there, acting like friends. Once inside, he relaxed a bit but still had the gun. He told me to make coffee and not try anything funny. As I made the coffee, he asked me about my job. I lied and said I was an ore-sled dispatcher, something I knew about from Linda.

He talked a lot, saying he wasn't a spy and that he came from another Project. He claimed the radiation outside was almost gone and that it was safe to go out again. He said he had been living outside for months and that it was time for people to leave the Projects and start living outside again. He was very passionate and seemed a little crazy.

He wanted to prove his point, so he pulled down the drape from my window and told me to look outside. I was terrified of the height, but he insisted. He said there were green plants growing again, which meant the radiation was down.

I pretended to see the green, and that made him let his guard down. I moved quickly, using my skills to disarm him and knock him out. I used wrestling, judo, and karati, all things I taught as a gymnastics instructor.

The Army came and took him away. They said he was just a spy who had lost his mind. Outside was still dangerous, they assured me. They even found the car he used to get here.

It was three o'clock by the time it was all over, and I was five hours late meeting Linda. Even with my good excuse, she wouldn't forgive me. She refused to marry me, but it turned out okay. After people heard my story, many girls wanted to meet me, including the lady from the Transit Staff.

081.txt,"Long ago, in the town of Itaguaí, there lived a certain doctor named Dr. Simão Bacamarte. He was a nobleman and the greatest doctor in Brazil, Portugal, and Spain. He studied in Coimbra and Padua and returned to Brazil at 34, despite the king's wishes for him to stay and work at the university or in Lisbon. Dr. Bacamarte only cared about science and said, ""Science is my sole employment; Itaguaí is my universe.""

He dedicated himself entirely to his work and studies. At 40, he married Dona Evarista da Costa e Mascarenhas, a 25-year-old widow who was neither pretty nor charming. A hunting uncle of his was surprised by such a choice. Dr. Bacamarte explained that Dona Evarista had excellent physiological and anatomical conditions and was well-suited to give him strong, healthy, and intelligent children.

However, Dona Evarista did not give him any children. After waiting several years, Dr. Bacamarte studied the matter deeply, consulted universities in Italy and Germany, and advised his wife to follow a special diet. But she ignored his advice, and this led to the extinction of the Bacamarte family.

Despite this, Dr. Bacamarte remained dedicated to his studies, particularly focusing on the mind and mental illness. He noticed that there was no authority on the subject in Brazil or Portugal, and he saw an opportunity for Brazilian science to achieve greatness.

""The health of the soul,"" he declared, ""is the most worthy occupation of a doctor.""

The town of Itaguaí didn't care much about the mentally ill, so Dr. Bacamarte asked the town council for permission to house and treat the mad in a building he would construct. He offered to take care of all the town's lunatics, charging a fee to the town if the family couldn't pay.

The people of Itaguaí were curious but resistant to his idea. Some even suggested that Dr. Bacamarte himself might be mad. Regardless, the council eventually gave him permission, and he started building what would become known as the Green House, a place to treat the mentally ill.

## II. A Flood of Lunatics

Once the Green House opened, lunatics came from all around to be treated. The building quickly filled, and Dr. Bacamarte had to expand it. It became a small community of the mentally ill, each with their own unique delusions.

Dr. Bacamarte showed incredible patience, studying each patient thoroughly. He divided them into categories and examined their habits, symptoms, and histories, trying to find a cure. He was so dedicated to his work that he barely ate or slept, spending all his time on his research.

## III. God Knows What He's Doing

Meanwhile, Dona Evarista became increasingly unhappy and melancholic. She felt like a widow and longed for her husband’s attention. Dr. Bacamarte, noticing her distress, suggested a trip to Rio de Janeiro. At first, she was reluctant, but the idea of visiting Rio excited her.

Dr. Bacamarte assured her that they had enough money for the trip. He showed her the family accounts, which were quite substantial, thanks to the success of the Green House. Dona Evarista agreed to the trip, and soon preparations began.

Dr. Bacamarte remained focused on his work, even as his wife prepared for her journey. He was more interested in the well-being of his patients than in his personal life.

## IV. A New Theory

While his wife was away, Dr. Bacamarte pondered a bold new theory about mental illness. He began to suspect that insanity was more widespread than previously thought. He shared his ideas with Crispim Soares, a local pharmacist, who was surprised but supportive.

Dr. Bacamarte believed that the perfect balance of all mental faculties defined sanity. Anything less was insanity. He set out to prove his theory, determined to redefine the boundaries of sanity and madness.

## V. Fear Spreads

Dr. Bacamarte began to identify more and more people as insane, admitting them to the Green House. This caused fear and unrest among the townspeople. They were shocked when a respected citizen named Costa was committed, and even more so when a woman who had merely spoken in his defense was also admitted.

The town was abuzz with rumors and speculation. People began to wonder if Dr. Bacamarte himself was insane. Despite the growing tension, Dr. Bacamarte continued his work, convinced of the validity of his theory.

## VI. The Rebellion

Frustrated by Dr. Bacamarte's actions, a group of townspeople, led by a barber named Porfírio, decided to rebel. They demanded the release of the lunatics and the closure of the Green House. The town council refused to listen to their demands, and the situation escalated.

Porfírio and his followers gathered a crowd and marched to the Green House, intent on freeing the patients. Dr. Bacamarte, however, remained calm and refused to back down. He believed in the righteousness of his cause and was determined to see it through.

## VII. The Unexpected

As the rebellion grew more intense, a group of soldiers arrived to restore order. Porfírio and his followers were defeated, and many were arrested. Dr. Bacamarte's authority was reaffirmed, and he continued his work without interference.

The town council, recognizing the doctor's expertise, allowed him to proceed with his experiments. Dr. Bacamarte, undeterred by the recent events, remained committed to his research and the pursuit of knowledge.

## VIII. The Apothecary's Anguish

Crispim Soares, who had been a supporter of Dr. Bacamarte, found himself in a difficult position. His wife had been committed to the Green House, and he struggled to reconcile his loyalty to the doctor with his concern for his wife.

Dr. Bacamarte assured Crispim that his wife's condition could be treated and that she would be released once she was cured. Crispim was torn but ultimately trusted Dr. Bacamarte's judgment.

## IX. Two Beautiful Cases

Dr. Bacamarte continued to refine his theory and methods. He identified two particularly interesting cases of mental illness and was eager to study them further. He was confident that his work would ultimately benefit humanity.

Despite the challenges he faced, Dr. Bacamarte remained steadfast in his belief that he was on the right path. He was determined to prove that his theory was correct and that his work would lead to a greater understanding of the human mind.

## X. Redemption

Eventually, Dr. Bacamarte's work led to the release of many patients from the Green House. His new theory suggested that the true measure of sanity was the ability to adapt to one's environment, rather than a strict adherence to a perfect mental balance.

The townspeople began to see the value of Dr. Bacamarte's work, and his reputation was restored. He was celebrated for his contributions to science and his dedication to the well-being of his patients.

## XI. The End of the Story

Dr. Bacamarte's work continued to evolve, and he remained a respected figure in the town of Itaguaí. His legacy lived on through his research and the lives he had touched.

Though he faced many challenges and setbacks, Dr. Bacamarte's unwavering commitment to his work ultimately led to a greater understanding of the complexities of the human mind. His story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around Dr. Simão Bacamarte's obsession with his scientific pursuits, particularly his study of mental illness, and the societal implications of his actions. This conflict manifests in several ways:

1. **Personal vs. Professional Life:** Dr. Bacamarte is so dedicated to his work that he neglects his personal life, including his marriage to Dona Evarista. His singular focus on science and mental health research leads to personal isolation and familial extinction, highlighting the tension between personal relationships and professional ambitions.

2. **Scientific Experimentation vs. Ethical Concerns:** Dr. Bacamarte's bold new theory on mental illness expands the definition of insanity, leading to many townspeople being committed to the Green House. This raises ethical questions about the boundaries of scientific experimentation and its impact on individuals' lives, as well as the potential for misuse of authority in the name of science.

3. **Individual Genius vs. Societal Norms:** The townspeople of Itaguaí are skeptical and fearful of Dr. Bacamarte's methods and theories. Their eventual rebellion, led by Porfírio, underscores the conflict between innovative ideas and societal resistance to change. The townspeople's fear and misunderstanding of Dr. Bacamarte's work reflect the broader struggle between pioneering scientific advancements and traditional societal norms.

4. **Madness vs. Sanity:** Dr. Bacamarte's redefinition of insanity challenges conventional perceptions of mental health. His work blurs the line between madness and sanity, leading to widespread fear and suspicion. The story questions the subjective nature of these concepts and explores the consequences of shifting their definitions.

Ultimately, the resolution of this conflict comes when Dr. Bacamarte refines his theory to recognize adaptability to one's environment as the true measure of sanity, which helps restore his reputation and underscores the complexity of understanding the human mind.

082.txt,"After the morning inspection, Tardo, the Solar Council's Planetary Aid agent, and his companion, Peo, were taken to the castle on the hill that overlooked the area.

Tardo and Peo were treated to a fancy lunch by Saranta, their host, who seemed to be the rich leader of this part of the planet. The meal was tasty—thick, tender steaks with a nice wine sauce and several of the planet's special vegetables, finished off with a cool fruit dessert.

“My recommendation will be important for you,” Tardo said as they ate. “If it's good, you'll get some technical help from the ship right away. But you won't get advanced equipment from the Solar Council until there's a more detailed investigation.”

“I’m afraid our society is too simple and farming-focused to get your approval,” said Saranta modestly.

“That isn't a big issue. The Council understands the challenges colonies face in other star systems. There are some basic rules, of course: no strange religious practices, no slavery... you get what I mean.”

“We think we've done well since we... our ancestors, that is... settled on our world a thousand years ago,” said Saranta, playing with a wineglass. A smiling servant filled the glasses of Tardo and Peo. “There was no fuel for the ship to check out other planets in the system, and the ship just rusted away. Since we're far from the solar system, yours is the first ship to land here since colonization.”

“You seem to have been lucky, though,” said Peo. He was the navigator of the Council ship and had asked to join Tardo on the quick inspection trip. “You could have landed on a barren planet.”

“Well, no, the colonizers knew it was livable from the first exploration,” said Saranta. “There were challenges, of course. Lots of plants, but no animals, so we had nothing to domesticate. Pulling a plow is tough work for people.”

“But you handled this problem in a humane way?” asked Tardo, looking at him closely. “I mean, you didn’t turn to slavery?”

Saranta smiled and spread his hands slightly.

“Does this look like a slave society to you?” he asked. “The colonists wanted to work together to make the planet livable. No one objected to work.”

“It’s true we haven’t seen any slaves, that we know of,” said Tardo. “But two days is a short time for inspection. I have to make most of my conclusions from the attitudes of you and the others who are our hosts. What about the servants here?”

“They are paid,” answered Saranta, and added with a rueful smile: “Some of us think they are paid too much. They have a union, you know.”

Tardo laughed.

“A carry-over from Earth, no doubt,” he commented. “An unusual one, too, for a culture without technology.”

After the meal, the two men from the ship were shown around the area. It was a neat farming community, with wide fields, well-built buildings, and, a short distance from Saranta’s castle-like home, a village where artisans and craftsmen did their peaceful work.

Peo tried to notice what he thought Tardo would look for on such a short inspection. The Council agent, he knew, had lots of training and many years of experience. It was hard for Peo to guess what things Tardo would find important—probably very small things that the average person wouldn’t notice, he thought.

Tardo seemed most interested in the question of slavery, and Peo looked for signs of it. He couldn’t see any. The planet's people had time to hide some things, of course. But the people they saw in the village looked proud and independent, not like slaves.

Saranta apologized for having to walk, explaining there was no other transportation on the planet.

“And, without transportation, you can see why we haven’t developed technology,” he added. “We hope transport will be part of the first assistance you give us.”

Tardo asked about the fields.

“I see there is no one working them,” he said. “Is that done by the villagers?”

“Our labor supply moves around,” answered Saranta after a brief pause. “The workers who will work our fields—for a wage, of course—are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now.”

Alpha Persei was setting in the western sky when Tardo and Peo left Saranta and headed down the road to their planetary landing craft.

“It looks like a good world to me,” said Peo. “If tomorrow’s inspection is as good, I guess you’ll recommend starting technical aid?”

“There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I will recommend against aid at this time,” replied Tardo. “I’ve seen enough.”

“Why?” asked Peo, surprised.

“There are two classes of people on this planet, and we’ve seen only one,” said Tardo. “Those we’ve seen are free people. The others are no better than animals. We don’t give aid that helps people tighten their hold over others.”

“If you haven’t seen them, how do you know there’s another class?” demanded Peo. “There’s no evidence of such a situation.”

“The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can handle it now, I’ll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000 years ago couldn’t carry animals. They had to rely on the planet’s native animal life, and this planet had none.”

“Saranta said that. But I don’t see…”

“Those were delicious steaks, weren’t they?” said Tardo quietly.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around the ethical and moral implications of providing technological aid to a society that seemingly hides a dark secret. Tardo, the Solar Council's Planetary Aid agent, and his companion, Peo, are tasked with evaluating whether the planet is eligible for aid. The primary concern for Tardo is whether the society is practicing slavery, which would disqualify them from receiving assistance.

Throughout the inspection, Tardo is suspicious of the society's claims of being free of slavery, despite their lack of technological advancement and transportation. The conflict reaches its climax when Tardo reveals his belief that the society maintains two classes of people: the free individuals they've met and an unseen class that is treated no better than animals. The unsettling revelation comes when Tardo suggests that the steaks they enjoyed at lunch were not from animals, as the planet has none, implying that they may have been consuming the flesh of this oppressed class.

The moral dilemma for Tardo is whether to recommend aid to a society that may be concealing such a grave ethical violation.

083.txt,"Beauclaire got his first ship at Sirius. He was called before the Commandant on a hot afternoon and stood awkwardly happy on the thick carpet. He was twenty-five and just out of the Academy. It was a great day.

The Commandant asked Beauclaire to sit and looked at him for a long time. The Commandant was an old man with many lines on his face. He was hot, tired, and irritated. He had reached an age where talking to young men was annoying because they were so confident and knew so little, and there was nothing he could do about it.

“All right,” the Commandant said, “there are a few things I need to tell you. Do you know where you’re going?”

“No, sir,” Beauclaire said cheerfully.

“All right,” the Commandant said again. “I’ll tell you. You’re going to the Hole in Cygnus. You’ve heard of it, I hope? Good. Well, the Hole is a big dust cloud—about ten light-years wide. We’ve never gone into the Hole for a number of reasons. It’s too thick for high speeds, it’s too big, and we’re short on Mapping Command ships. Plus, we never thought there was anything in the Hole worth seeing. So we’ve never gone into it. Your ship will be the first.”

“Yes, sir,” Beauclaire said, his eyes shining.

“A few weeks ago,” the Commandant said, “one of our amateurs was looking at the Hole and saw a glow. He reported it, we checked, and saw it too. There’s a faint light coming from the Hole—likely a sun, a star inside the cloud, just far enough in to be almost invisible. God knows how long it’s been there, but there’s no record of light in the Hole. Apparently, this star went in some time ago and is now coming out. It’s just reaching the edge of the cloud. Do you follow?”

“Yes, sir,” Beauclaire said.

“Your job is this: You’ll check that sun for livable planets and alien life. If you find anything—which is unlikely—you’re to figure out the language and come right back. A Psych team will go out to see how a starless sky affects alien culture—these people will have never seen stars.”

The Commandant leaned forward, focused for the first time.

“This is an important job. There were no other linguists available, so we passed over a lot of good men to pick you. Make no mistake about your qualifications. You’re not spectacular. But the ship will be yours from now on. Got it?”

The young man nodded, grinning.

“There’s something else,” the Commandant said, pausing abruptly. He looked at Beauclaire—at the crisp gray uniform, the young, smooth face—and thought bitterly of the Hole in Cygnus he, an old man, would never see. He told himself to stop feeling sorry for himself. The important thing was coming up, and he had to say it well.

“Listen,” he said strongly, and Beauclaire blinked. “You’re replacing one of our oldest men. One of our best, Billy Wyatt. He’s been with us a long time.” The Commandant paused again, playing with his desk blotter. “They’ve told you a lot at the Academy, which is important. But I want you to understand something else: Mapping Command is hard work—few men last long, and those who do aren’t much good in the end. You know that. Well, be careful when you talk to Billy Wyatt; listen to him because he’s been around longer than anyone. We’re relieving him because he’s breaking down. He’s no good for us anymore; he’s lost the feeling a man needs to do his job right.”

The Commandant got up slowly and looked into Beauclaire’s eyes.

“When you relieve Wyatt, treat him with respect. He’s seen more than any man you’ll ever meet. No jokes and no pity for him. Because, listen, sooner or later the same thing will happen to you. Why? Because it’s too big,” the Commandant spread his hands helplessly, “it’s all just too big. Space is never so big that it can’t get bigger. If you fly long enough, it will finally get too big to make any sense, and you’ll start thinking it doesn’t make sense. On that day, we’ll bring you back and put you in an office somewhere. If we leave you alone, you’ll lose ships and get good men killed—there’s nothing we can do when space gets too big. That’s what happened to Wyatt. That’s what will happen to you. Understand?”

The young man nodded uncertainly.

“And that,” the Commandant said sadly, “is the lesson for today. Take your ship. Wyatt will go with you on this trip, to break you in. Pay attention to what he says—it will mean something. There’s one other crewman, a man named Cooper. You’ll be flying with him now. Keep your ears open and your mouth shut, except for questions. And don’t take any chances. That’s all.”

Beauclaire saluted and rose to go.

“When you see Wyatt,” the Commandant said, “tell him I won’t be able to make it down before you leave. Too busy. Got papers to sign. Got more papers than the chief has ulcers.”

The young man waited.

“That, God help you, is all,” said the Commandant.

Wyatt saw the letter when Beauclaire was still far off. The white paper caught his eye, and he watched idly for a moment. Then he saw the fresh green gear on the man’s back and his eager face as he climbed the ladder, and Wyatt stopped breathing.

He stood for a moment blinking in the sun. Me? he thought ... me?

Beauclaire reached the platform and dropped his gear, thinking this was a heck of a way to start a career.

Wyatt nodded but said nothing. He took the letter, opened it, and read it. He was a short man, thick, dark, and very strong. His face didn’t change as he read.

“Well,” he said when he finished, “thank you.”

There was a long pause, and Wyatt said at last, “Is the Commandant coming down?”

“No, sir. He said he was busy. He said to give you his best.”

“That’s nice,” Wyatt said.

After that, neither spoke. Wyatt showed Beauclaire to his room and wished him luck. Then he went back to his cabin to think.

After 28 years in Mapping Command, he was used to surprises; he understood at once, but it would take time before he reacted. Well, well, he told himself; but he didn’t feel it.

Vaguely, flicking cigarettes onto the floor, he wondered why. The letter didn’t give a reason. He’d probably failed a physical. Or a mental. One or the other, both good enough reasons. He was 47 years old, and this was tough work. Still, he felt strong and careful, and he knew he wasn’t afraid. He felt good for a long while yet ... but obviously, he wasn’t.

Well, then, he thought, where now?

He considered that with interest. There was no particular place for him to go. Really no place. He had come into the business easily and naturally, knowing what he wanted—which was simply to move, listen, and see. When he was young, adventure alone drew him; now it was something else he couldn’t define, but a thing he needed badly. He had to see, to watch ... and understand.

It was ending, the long time was ending. It didn’t matter what was wrong with him. The point was he was through. The point was he was going home, to nowhere in particular.

When evening came, he was still in his room. Eventually, he accepted it all clearly and realized there was nothing to do. If there was anything out in space he hadn’t found yet, he wouldn’t likely need it.

He stopped sitting and went up to the control room.

Cooper was waiting for him. Cooper was tall, bearded, scrawny, with a great temper and heart but a small capacity for liquor. He was all alone in the room when Wyatt came in.

Except for the pearl-green glow of dashlights from the panel, the room was dark. Cooper lay far back in the pilot’s seat, feet propped on the panel. One shoe was off, and he pressed buttons carefully with his big bare toes. The first thing Wyatt saw was the foot glowing luridly in the panel’s green light. Deep within the ship, he heard the hum of dynamos starting and stopping.

Wyatt grinned. From Cooper’s toes, the attitude, and the limp, forgotten arm hanging loosely from the chair, it was clear Cooper was drunk. In port, he was usually drunk. He was a likable man with few cares and no manners at all, typical of men in that Command.

“What say, Billy?” Cooper mumbled from deep in the seat.

Wyatt sat down. “Where you been?”

“In the port. Been drinkin’ in the goddam port. Hot!”

“Bring back any?”

Cooper waved an arm floppily in no particular direction. “Look around.”

Flasks lay in a heap by the door. Wyatt took one and sat down again. The room was warm, green, and silent. The two men had been together long enough to sit without speaking, and in the green glow, they waited, thinking. Wyatt’s first pull was long and numbing; he closed his eyes.

Cooper didn’t move. Not even his toes. When Wyatt thought he was asleep, he spoke suddenly:

“Heard about the replacement.”

Wyatt looked at him.

“Found out this afternoon,” Cooper said, “from the goddam Commandant.”

Wyatt closed his eyes again.

“Where you goin’?” Cooper asked.

Wyatt shrugged. “Plush job.”

“Got any plans?”

Wyatt shook his head.

Cooper swore moodily. “Never let you alone,” he muttered. “Miserable bastards.” He sat up suddenly, pointing a long matchstick finger into Wyatt’s face. “Listen, Billy,” he said with determination, “you was a good man, you know that? You was one hell of a good goddam man.”

Wyatt took another long pull and nodded, smiling.

“You said it,” he said.

“I sailed with some good men, some good men,” Cooper insisted, stabbing shakily but emphatically with his finger, “but you don’t take nothin’ from nobody.”

“Here’s to me, I’m true blue,” Wyatt grinned.

Cooper sank back, satisfied. “I just wanted you should know. You been a good man.”

“Betcher sweet life,” Wyatt said.

“So they throw you out. Me they keep. You they throw out. They got no brains.”

Wyatt lay back, letting the liquor take hold, receding without pain into a quiet world. The ship was good to feel around him, dark and throbbing like a living womb. Just like a womb, he thought. It’s a lot like a womb.

“Listen,” Cooper said thickly, rising. “I think I’ll quit this racket. What the hell I wanna stay in this racket for?”

Wyatt looked up, startled. When Cooper was drunk, he was never a little drunk. He was always far gone, and he could be very mean. Wyatt saw now he was deep and sinking; the replacement was a big thing to him, bigger than Wyatt had expected. In this team, Wyatt had been the leader, and it had seldom occurred to him that Cooper really needed him. He’d never really thought about it. But now he let himself realize that, alone, Cooper could be very bad. Unless this new man was worth anything and learned quickly, Cooper would likely get himself killed.

Now, more than ever, this replacement thing was ridiculous; but for Cooper’s sake, Wyatt said quickly:

“Drop that, man. You’ll be on this ship in the boneyard. You even look like this ship—you got a bright red bow.”

When the tall man was dark and silent, Wyatt said gently, “Coop. Easy. We leave at midnight. Want me to take her up?”

“Naw.” Cooper turned away abruptly, shaking his head. “T’hell with you. Go die.” He sank back deeply, his gaunt face reflecting the green glow from the panel. His next words were sad, and, to Wyatt, very touching.

“Hell, Billy,” Cooper said wearily, “this ain’ no fun.”

Wyatt let him take the ship up alone. There was no reason to argue. Cooper was drunk; his mind was unreachable.

At midnight, the ship bucked and heaved, leaping into the sky. Wyatt hung to a stanchion by a port, watched the night lights recede, and the stars begin blooming. In a few moments, the last clouds were past, and they were out in the long night, the million million speckled points of glittering blue, red, and silver burning once more with the mighty light which was, to Wyatt, all that was real or had ever meant living. In the great glare and the black, he stood, as always, waiting for something to happen, for the huge lonely beauty to resolve to a pattern and descend and be understood.

It did not. It was just space, an area in which things existed, in which mechanized substance moved. Wondering, waiting, Wyatt regarded the Universe. The stars looked icily back.

At last, almost completely broken, Wyatt went to bed.

Beauclaire’s first days passed quickly. He spent them exploring the ship, seeking her out in her deepest layers, watching and touching and loving. The ship was to him like a woman; the first few days were his honeymoon. Because there is no lonelier job a man can have, it was nearly always this way with men in the Command.

Wyatt and Cooper left him alone. They didn’t come looking for him, and the few times he did see them, he couldn’t help but feel their surprise and resentment. Wyatt was always polite. Cooper was not. Neither seemed to have anything to say to Beauclaire, and he was wise enough to stay by himself. Most of Beauclaire’s life until now had been spent among books and ancient languages. He was by nature a solitary man, and therefore it wasn’t difficult for him to be alone.

One morning, some weeks after the trip began, Wyatt came looking for him. Eyes twinkling, Wyatt found him, grease-coated and embarrassed, out of a shaft between the main dynamos. Together they went up toward the astrogation dome. Under the great dome, beneath the massive crystal sheet on the other side of which there was nothing forever and ever, Beauclaire saw beauty he’d remember as long as he lived.

They were nearing the Hole in Cygnus. On the side facing the Galaxy’s center, the Hole is almost flat, from top to bottom, like a wall. They were moving in on the flat side now, floating some distance from the wall, which was so huge and incredible that Beauclaire was struck dumb.

It began above him, light-years high. It came down in a black, rushing silence, fell away beneath him for millions of miles, passed beyond sight so unbelievably far away, so vast, that there could be nothing as big as this, and if he hadn’t seen the stars blazing on either side, he’d have had to believe the wall was just outside the glass, so close he could touch it. From all over the wall, a haze reflected faintly, so the wall stood out in ridges and folds from the great black of space. Beauclaire looked up and then down and then stood and gazed.

After a while, Wyatt pointed down. Beauclaire looked in among the folds and saw it, the tiny yellow gleam toward which they were moving. It was so small against the massive cloud that he lost it easily.

Each time he took his eyes away, he lost it, and had to search for it again.

“It’s not too far in,” Wyatt said at last, breaking the silence. “We’ll move down the cloud to the nearest point, then we’ll slow down and move in. Should take a couple of days.”

Beauclaire nodded.

“Thought you’d like to see,” Wyatt said.

“Thanks.” Beauclaire was sincerely grateful. And then, unable to contain himself, he shook his head with wonder. “My God!” he said.

Wyatt smiled. “It’s a big show.”

Later, much later, Beauclaire began to remember what the Commandant had said about Wyatt. But he couldn’t understand it at all. Sure, something like the Hole was incomprehensible. It didn’t make any sense—but so what? A thing as beautiful as that, Beauclaire thought, didn’t have to make sense.

They reached the sun slowly. The gas wasn’t thick by Earthly standards—about one atom to every cubic mile of space—but for a starship, any matter at all is too much. At normal speeds, the ship would hit the gas like a wall. So they came in slowly, swung in and around the large yellow sun.

They saw one planet almost immediately. While moving toward that one, they scanned for others, found none.

Space around them was strange; nothing in the sky but a faint haze. They were in the cloud now, and of course, could see no star. Nothing but the huge sun and the green gleaming dot of that one planet and the endless haze.

From a good distance out, Wyatt and Cooper ran through the standard tests while Beauclaire watched with delight. They checked for radio signals, found none. The planet’s spectrum revealed strong oxygen and water-vapor lines, surprisingly little nitrogen. The temperature, while cool, was livable.

It was a habitable planet.

“Jackpot!” Cooper said cheerfully. “All that oxygen, bound to be some kind of life.”

Wyatt said nothing. He sat in the pilot chair, huge hands on the controls, nursing the ship into the long slow spiral that would take them down. He thought of many other things, many other landings. He remembered the acid ocean at Lupus and the rotting disease of Altair, all the dark, vicious, unknowable things he’d approached unsuspecting over the years.

... So many years, that now he suddenly realized it was too long, too long.

Cooper, grinning unconsciously as he scanned with the telescope, didn’t notice Wyatt’s sudden freeze.

It was over all at once. Wyatt’s knuckles had gradually whitened as he gripped the panel. Sweat had formed on his face and run into his eyes, and he blinked, realizing with a strange numbness that he was soaking wet all over. In that moment, his hands froze and gripped the panel, and he couldn’t move them.

It was a hell of a thing to happen on a man’s last trip, he thought. He’d like to have taken her down just this once. He sat looking at his hands. Gradually, calmly, carefully, with a cold will and a welling sadness, he broke his hands away from the panel.

“Coop,” he said, “take over.”

Cooper glanced over and saw. Wyatt’s face was white and glistening; his hands in front of him were wooden and strange.

“Sure,” Cooper said, after a long moment. “Sure.”

Wyatt backed off, and Cooper slid into the seat.

“They got me just in time,” Wyatt said, looking at his stiff fingers. He looked up and ran into Beauclaire’s wide eyes, turning away from the open pity. Cooper was bending over the panel, swallowing heavily.

“Well,” Wyatt said. He began to cry. He walked slowly from the room, his hands held before him like old gray things that had died.

The ship circled automatically throughout the night, while its crew slept or tried to. In the morning, they were all forcefully cheerful and began to work up an interest.

There were people on the planet. Because the people lived in villages, and had no cities and no apparent science, Cooper let the ship land.

It was unreal. For a long while, none of them could get over the feeling of unreality, Wyatt least of all. He stayed in the ship and got briefly drunk, then came out as efficiently as ever. Cooper was gay and brittle. Only Beauclaire saw the planet clearly. And all the while, the people looked back.

From the beginning, it was peculiar.

The people saw the ship passing overhead, yet curiously didn’t run. They gathered in groups and watched. When the ship landed, a small band came from the woods and hills and ringed the ship, with a few touching it calmly, fingers running over smooth steel sides.

The people were human.

There wasn’t, as far as Beauclaire could tell, a single significant difference. It wasn’t extraordinary—similar conditions generally breed similar races—but there was something about these men and women that was hard and powerful, and almost grand.

They were magnificently built, rounded and bronzed. Their women especially were remarkably beautiful. They wore woven clothes of various colors, in simple savage fashions; but there was nothing savage about them. They didn’t shout or seem nervous or move much, and nowhere among them was there any sign of a weapon. Furthermore, they didn’t seem particularly curious. The ring around the ship didn’t grow. Although several new people wandered in from time to time, others left, unconcerned. The only ones who seemed excited were the children.

Beauclaire stood by the view-screen, watching. Eventually, Cooper joined him, looking without interest until he saw the women. There was one particular girl with shaded brown eyes and a body of gentle hills. Cooper grinned widely and turned up the magnification until the screen showed nothing but the girl. He was gazing with appreciation and making side comments to Beauclaire when Wyatt came in.

“Looka that, Billy,” Cooper roared with delight, pointing. “Man, we have come home!”

Wyatt smiled tightly, changed the magnification quickly to cover the whole throng around them.

“No trouble?”

“Nope,” Cooper said. “Air’s good, too. Thin, but practically pure oxygen. Who’s first to go out?”

“Me,” Wyatt said, for obvious reasons. He wouldn’t be missed.

No one argued. Cooper was smiling as Wyatt armed himself. Then he warned Wyatt to leave that cute brown-eyed doll alone.

Wyatt went out.

The air was clear and cool. There was a faint breeze stirring the leaves, and Wyatt listened momentarily to the far bell-calls of birds. This would be the last time he’d ever go out like this, to walk on an unknown world. He waited for some time by the airlock before going forward.

The ring of people didn’t move as he approached, his hand upraised in what the Mapping Command had come to rely on as the universal gesture of peace. He paused before a tall, monolithic old man in a single sheath of green cloth.

“Hello,” he said aloud, bowing his head slowly.

From the ship, through the wide-angle sights of a gun, Beauclaire watched breathlessly as Wyatt went through the pantomime of greeting.

None of the tall people moved, except the old man, who folded his arms and looked openly amused. When the pantomime was done, Wyatt bowed again. The old man broke into a broad grin, looked amiably around at the circle of people, and then quite suddenly bowed to Wyatt. One by one, the people, grinning, bowed.

Wyatt turned and waved at the ship, and Beauclaire stood away from his gun, smiling.

It was a very fine way to begin.

In the morning, Wyatt went out alone, to walk in the sun among the trees, and he found the girl he’d seen from the ship. She was sitting alone by a stream, her feet splashing in the clear water.

Wyatt sat down beside her. She looked up, unsurprised, out of eyes that were rich and grained like small pieces of beautiful wood. Then she bowed from the waist. Wyatt grinned and bowed back.

Unceremoniously, he took off his boots and let his feet plunk into the water. It was shockingly cold, and he whistled. The girl smiled at him. To his surprise, she began to hum softly. It was a pretty tune he was able to follow, and after a moment, he picked up the harmony and hummed with her. She laughed, and he laughed with her, feeling very young.

Me Billy, he thought of saying, and laughed again. He was content just to sit without saying anything. Even her body, which was magnificent, didn’t move him to anything but quiet admiration, and he regarded himself with wonder.

The girl picked up one of his boots and examined it critically, clucking with interest. Her lovely eyes widened as she played with the buckle. Wyatt showed her how the snaps worked, and she was delighted and clapped her hands.

Wyatt brought other things from his pockets, and she examined them one after the other. The picture of him on his ID card was the only one that puzzled her. She handled it, looked at it then at him, and shook her head. Eventually, she frowned and gave it back. He got the impression she thought it was very bad art. He chuckled.

The afternoon passed quickly, and the sun began to go down. They hummed some more and sang songs to each other which neither understood and both enjoyed. It didn’t occur to Wyatt until much later how little curiosity they’d felt. They didn’t speak at all. She had no interest in his language or his name, and, strangely, he felt all afternoon that talking was unnecessary. It was a very rare day spent between two people who weren’t curious and didn’t want anything from each other. The only words they said were goodbye.

Wyatt, lost inside himself, went back to the ship.

In the first week, Beauclaire spent every waking hour learning the language of the planet. From the beginning, he felt a peculiar manner about these people. Their behavior was unusual. Although they didn’t differ much from human beings, they almost wholly lacked a sense of awe, a sense of wonder. Only the children seemed surprised that the ship had landed, and only the children hung around and inspected it. Almost all the others went about their regular business—farming—and when Beauclaire tried learning the language, he found few people willing to spend time teaching him.

But they were always polite, and by being persistent, he began to succeed. One day when Wyatt came back from the brown-eyed girl, Beauclaire reported some progress.

“It’s a beautiful language,” he said as Wyatt came in. “Amazingly well-developed. It’s like our Latin—same type of construction, but softer and more flexible. I’ve been trying to read their book.”

Wyatt sat thoughtfully and lit a cigarette.

“Book?” he said.

“Yes. They have lots of books, but everybody has this one in particular—they keep it in a place of honor. I’ve tried asking what it is—I think it’s a bible—but they just won’t bother to tell me.”

Wyatt shrugged, his mind drifting away.

“I just don’t understand them,” Beauclaire said, glad to have someone to talk to. “I don’t get them at all. They’re quick, they’re bright, but they don’t have any curiosity about anything, not even each other. They don’t even gossip!”

Wyatt, contented, puffed quietly. “Do you think not seeing the stars has something to do with it? Ought to have slowed down the development of physics and math.”

Beauclaire shook his head. “No. It’s strange. There’s something else. Have you noticed how the ground seems sharp and jagged everywhere, sort of chewed up like there was a war? Yet these people swear they’ve never had a war, and they don’t keep any history.”

When Wyatt didn’t say anything, he went on:

“And I can’t see the connection about no stars. Not with these people. I don’t care if you can’t see the roof of the house you live in, you still have to have some curiosity to stay alive. But these people just don’t care. The ship landed. You remember that? Out of the sky come Gods like thunder—”

Wyatt smiled. At another time, at any time in the past, he would have been very interested in this sort of thing. But now he was not. He felt himself remote, and he, like these people, didn’t particularly care.

But the problem bothered Beauclaire, who was fresh and looking for reasons, and it also bothered Cooper.

“Damn!” Coop grumbled as he came into the room. “Here you are, Billy. I’m bored stiff. Been all over this whole place looking for you. Where you been?” He folded himself into a chair, scratched his black hair broodingly with long, sharp fingers. “Game o’ cards?”

“Not just now, Coop,” Wyatt said, resting.

Coop grunted. “Nothin to do, nothin to do,” he swiveled his eyes to Beauclaire. “How you comin, son? How soon we leave this place? Like Sunday afternoon all the time.”

Beauclaire was always ready to talk about the problem. He outlined it again to Cooper, and Wyatt, listening, grew very tired. There’s just this one continent, Beauclaire said, and just one nation, and everyone spoke the same tongue. There was no government, no police, no law he could find. There wasn’t even, as far as he could tell, a system of marriage. You couldn’t call it a society, really, but dammit, it existed—and Beauclaire couldn’t find a trace of rape or murder or violence of any kind. The people here just didn’t care.

“You said it,” Coop boomed. “I think they’re all whacky.”

“But happy,” Wyatt said suddenly. “You can see they’re happy.”

“Sure, they’re happy,” Coop chortled. “They’re nuts. They got funny looks in their eyes. Happiest guys I know are screwy as—”

The sound which cut him off, which grew and explained everything, had begun seconds ago, too softly to be heard. Now suddenly, from a slight rushing noise, it burst into an enormous, thundering scream.

They leaped up together, horrified, and an overwhelming blast threw them to the floor.

The ground rocked, the ship fluttered crazily. In that long second, the monstrous noise of a world collapsing grew in the air and filled everything with one incredible, crushing shock.

When it was over, there was another rushing sound, farther away, and another, and two more explosions; and though all in all the noise lasted for five seconds, it was the greatest any of them had ever heard, and the world beneath them fluttered, wounded and trembling, for several minutes.

Wyatt was first out of the ship, shaking his head as he ran to get back his hearing. To the west, over a long slight rise of trees, a vast black cloud of smoke, several miles long and very high, was rising and boiling. As he stared and tried to steady his feet upon the shaking ground, he realized what this was.

Meteors.

He had heard meteors before, long before, on a world of Aldebaran. Now he could smell the same sharp burning disaster and feel the wind rushing wildly back to the west, where the meteors had struck and hurled the air away.

In that moment, Wyatt thought of the girl, and although she meant nothing to him at all—none of these people meant anything to him—he began running as fast as he could toward the west.

Behind him, white-faced and bewildered, came Beauclaire and Cooper.

When Wyatt reached the top of the rise, the great cloud covered the whole valley before him. Fires were burning in the forest to his right, and from the lay of the cloud, he could tell that the village was gone.

He ran down into the smoke, circling toward the woods and the stream where he’d spent an afternoon with the girl. For a while, he lost himself in the smoke, stumbling over rocks and fallen trees.

Gradually the smoke lifted, and he began running into some of the people. Now he wished he could speak the language.

They were all wandering quietly away from the site of their village, none looking back. Wyatt could see many dead as he moved, but he had no time to stop or wonder. It was twilight now, and the sun was gone. He thanked God he had a flashlight with him; long after night came, he was searching in the raw gash where the first meteor had fallen.

He found the girl, dazed and bleeding, in a cleft between two rocks. He knelt and took her in his arms. Gently, gratefully, through the night and past the broken and the dead, he carried her back to the ship.

It had all become clear to Beauclaire. He talked with the people and began to understand.

The meteors had been falling since the beginning of time, so the people said. Perhaps it was the fault of the great dust-cloud through which this planet was moving; perhaps it was that this had not always been a one-planet system—a number of other planets, broken by unknown forces, would provide enough meteors for a very long time. And the air being thin, there was no real protection as on Earth. So year after year, the meteors fell. In unpredictable places, at unknowable times, the meteors fell, like stones from the sling of God. They had been falling since the beginning of time. So the people said.

And here was Beauclaire’s clue. Terrified and shaken as he was, Beauclaire was the kind of man who saw reason in everything. He followed this one to the end.

In the meantime, Wyatt nursed the girl. She hadn’t been badly hurt and recovered quickly. But her family and friends were mostly dead now, and so she had no reason to leave the ship.

Gradually Wyatt learned the language. The girl’s name was ridiculous when spoken in English, so he called her Donna, which was something like her real name. She was, like all her people, unconcerned about the meteors and her dead. She was extraordinarily cheerful. Her features were classic, her cheeks slim and smiling, her teeth perfect. In the joy and whiteness of her, Wyatt saw each day what he had seen and known in his mind on the day the meteors fell. Love to him was something new. He wasn’t sure whether he was in love, and he didn’t care. He realized he needed this girl and was at home with her, could rest with her and talk with her, and watch her walk and understand what beauty was; and in those days, a great peace began to settle over him.

When the girl was well again, Beauclaire was in the middle of translating the book—the bible-like book which all the people seemed to treasure. As his work progressed, a striking change began to come over him. He spent much time alone under the sky, watching the soft haze through which, very soon, the stars would begin to shine.

He tried to explain what he felt to Wyatt, but Wyatt had no time.

“But, Billy,” Beauclaire said, “do you see what these people go through? Do you see how they live?”

Wyatt nodded, but his eyes were on the girl as she listened dreamily to a recording of ancient music.

“They live every day waiting,” Beauclaire said. “They have no idea what the meteors are. They don’t know there’s anything else in the Universe but their planet and their sun. They think that’s all there is. They don’t know why they’re here—but when the meteors keep falling like that, they have only one conclusion.”

Wyatt turned from the girl smiling. None of this could touch him. He had seen the order and beauty of space, the incredible perfection of the Universe, so often and so deeply that, like Beauclaire, he couldn’t help but believe in a Purpose, a grand final meaning. When his father died of an insect bite at Oberon, he believed in a purpose for that and looked for it. When his first crewmate fell into the acid ocean of Alcestis and the second died of rot, Wyatt saw purpose, purpose; and each time another man died, for no apparent reason, on windless, evil useless worlds, the meaning of things had become clearer and clearer, and now in the end, Wyatt was approaching the truth, which was perhaps that none of it mattered at all.

It especially didn’t matter now. So many things had happened that he had lost the capacity to pay attention. He was not young anymore; he wanted to rest, and upon the bosom of this girl, he had all the reason for anything and everything he needed.

But Beauclaire was incoherent. It seemed to him that here on this planet, a great wrong was being done, and the more he thought of it, the more angry and confused he became. He went off by himself and looked at the wound on the planet, at all the sweet, lovely, fragrant things which would never be again, and he ended by cursing the nature of things, as Wyatt had done so many years before. Then he went on with the translation of the book. He came upon the final passage, still cursing inwardly, and reread it again and again. When the sun was rising on a brilliant new morning, he went back to the ship.

“They had a man here once,” he said to Wyatt, “who was as good a writer as there ever was. He wrote a book which these people use as their Bible. It’s like our Bible sometimes, but mostly it’s just the opposite. It preaches that a man shouldn’t worship anything. Would you like to hear some of it?”

Wyatt had been pinned down, and he had to listen, feeling sorry for Beauclaire, who had such a long way to go. His thoughts were on Donna, who had gone out alone to walk in the woods and say goodbye to her world. Soon he would go out and bring her back to the ship, and she would probably cry a little, but she would come. She would come with him always, wherever he went.

“I’ve translated this the best way I could,” Beauclaire said thickly, “but remember this. This man could write. He was Shakespeare and Voltaire and all the rest all at once. He could make you feel. I couldn’t do a decent translation if I tried forever, but please listen and try to get what he means. I’ve put it in the style of Ecclesiastes because it’s something like that.”

“All right,” Wyatt said.

Beauclaire waited for a long moment, feeling this deeply. When he read, his voice was warm and strong, and something of his emotion came through. As Wyatt listened, he found his attention attracted, and then he felt the last traces of his sadness and weariness fall away.

He nodded, smiling.

These are the words Beauclaire had gathered from the Book:

Rise up smiling, and walk with me. Rise up in the armor of thy body and what shall pass shall make thee unafraid. Walk among the yellow hills, for they belong to thee. Walk upon grass and let thy feet descend into soft soil; in the end when all has failed thee the soil shall comfort thee, the soil shall receive thee and in thy dark bed thou shalt find such peace as is thy portion.

In thine armor, hear my voice. In thine armor, hear. Whatsoever thou doest, thy friend and thy brother and thy woman shall betray thee. Whatsoever thou dost plant, the weeds and the seasons shall spite thee. Wheresoever thou goest, the heavens shall fall upon thee. Though the nations shall come unto thee in friendship thou art curst. Know that the Gods ignore thee. Know that thou art Life, and that pain shall forever come into thee, though thy years be without end and thy days without sleep, even and forever. And knowing this, in thine armor, thou shalt rise up.

Red and full and glowing is thy heart; a steel is forging within thy breast. And what can hurt thee now? In thy granite mansion, what can hurt thee ever? Thou shalt only die. Therefore seek not redemption nor forgiveness for thy sins, for know that thou hast never sinned.

Let the Gods come unto thee.

When it was finished, Wyatt sat very still.

Beauclaire was looking at him intently.

Wyatt nodded. “I see,” he said.

“They don’t ask for anything,” Beauclaire said. “No immortality, no forgiveness, no happiness. They take what comes and don’t wonder.”

Wyatt smiled, rising. He looked at Beauclaire for a long while, trying to think of something to say. But there was nothing to say. If the young man could believe this, here and now, he would save himself a long, painful journey. But Wyatt couldn’t talk about it—not yet.

He reached out and clapped Beauclaire gently on the shoulder. Then he left the ship and walked out toward the yellow hills, toward the girl and the love waiting.

What will they do, Beauclaire asked himself, when the stars come out? When there are other places to go, will these people, too, begin to seek?

They would. With sadness, he knew they would. For there is a chord in Man which is plucked by the stars, which will rise upward and outward into infinity, as long as there is one man anywhere and one lonely place to which he has not been. And therefore what does the meaning matter? We are built in this way, and so shall we live.

Beauclaire looked up into the sky.

Dimly, faintly, like God’s eye peeking through the silvery haze, a single star had begun to shine.

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOOK, by Michael Shaara ***",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the existential and philosophical dilemmas faced by the characters as they confront the vastness of space, the randomness of life, and the search for meaning. This is embodied in several layers:

1. **Beauclaire's Mission and Discovery:** Beauclaire is tasked with exploring a newly discovered star and potential habitable planet within the Hole in Cygnus. The conflict here is his struggle to understand the nature of the people on the planet, who live without curiosity or fear despite the constant threat of meteors. Beauclaire's challenge is to comprehend a culture so different from his own, questioning the human drive for exploration and understanding.

2. **Wyatt's Internal Struggle:** Wyatt, an experienced but weary Mapping Command officer, faces a personal conflict about his relevance and purpose. As he's replaced by Beauclaire, Wyatt confronts his own obsolescence and the toll that a life of exploration has taken on him. His relationship with Donna represents a personal resolution, finding peace and acceptance in love despite the randomness of life and the indifference of the universe.

3. **The Philosophical Inquiry:** The story also explores a deeper philosophical conflict about the nature of existence and the search for meaning. This is encapsulated in the book that Beauclaire translates, which preaches self-reliance and acceptance of life's arbitrary nature without seeking redemption or divine intervention. The people on the planet embody this philosophy, living without fear or expectation despite their harsh circumstances.

4. **The Impact of Stars on Human Nature:** The potential emergence of stars in the planet's sky symbolizes the awakening of curiosity and the human spirit's inevitable drive to explore and seek meaning beyond the immediate world. This raises the conflict of whether the people, once exposed to the stars, will change and begin to seek answers and explore as humans have done.

Overall, the story's central conflict lies in the characters' navigation of their internal and external worlds, the quest for understanding amidst the chaos of existence, and the acceptance of life's inherent uncertainties.","Would you explore a planet where people show no curiosity, even if meteors could crush them at any moment?","How would you feel if your life’s work in space exploration was deemed obsolete, just as you discovered a world without wonder?","When stars begin to shine, will they awaken a restless spirit in a world that knows only calm? What would you do?",science fiction,tragedy,coming of age,Where did Beauclaire get his first ship?,Beauclaire got his first ship at Sirius.,Why was the Commandant irritated when talking to Beauclaire?,"The Commandant was irritated because he was hot, tired, and found talking to confident young men who knew little to be annoying.",What is Beauclaire's mission in the Hole in Cygnus?,"Beauclaire's mission is to check the sun in the Hole for livable planets and alien life, and if he finds anything, to figure out the language and report back.",How does the Commandant's view of space reflect on his advice to Beauclaire?,"The Commandant views space as vast and overwhelming, which is why he advises Beauclaire to respect Wyatt and warns him that eventually, space will become too big to make sense, leading to a breakdown similar to Wyatt's.",Do you think Wyatt's reaction to being replaced is justified? Why or why not?,"Wyatt's reaction is justified because after 28 years in Mapping Command, he feels strong and capable, yet he is being replaced due to a perceived breakdown. His mixed feelings of resignation and sadness reflect the difficulty of accepting the end of a long career.",What might happen to the people on the planet when the stars become visible?,"When the stars become visible, the people on the planet might develop a sense of curiosity and wonder, leading them to explore and seek new knowledge, as Beauclaire speculates that the stars will inspire them to seek beyond their current existence.",0.547424658,0.5347307503,0.136150406,0.7382665405,0.5275398255,0.5205078031,0.03446045993,0.5291855205,0.5232324121,0.3419655016,0.4532721711,0.1464021035,0.5382485637,0.5286035663,0.03250586476,0.5389415884,0.3564754557,0.05871317345,0.4348632839,0.5323067793,0.6175279371,0.518011928,0.5317324592,0.5269629732,0.5263017492,0.04816630385,0.1284918221,0.4530548994,0.5318623186,0.5340355696,0.626429266,0.1425063539,0.3645421744,0.835267908,0.5191754799,0.5391065847,0.5043807443,0.539350287,0.5169912144,0.04628423656,0.1218495062,0.5482929265,0.121485779,0.5376328253,0.4541257348,0.4594784985,0.3487093001,0.8193374455,0.1365357691,0.3344230731,0.03977235528,0.4436171752,0.02758764121,0.5359550597,0.5317962823,0.4239005309,0.3386098616,0.5282019626,1,0.4402515174,0.8518978268,0.1215442102,0.3422273119,0.1097108514,0.524720862,0.1255806965,0.3430413965,0.5228641158,0.5434349514,0.4339683171
084.txt,"Andrei Vasilyevitch Kovrin, a scholar, had worn himself out and unsettled his nerves. He didn't go through regular treatment but casually mentioned his condition to his doctor friend while having wine. The doctor suggested he spend the spring and summer in the countryside. Around the same time, he received a long letter from Tnya Pestsky, inviting him to visit her father at Borisovka. He decided to go.

First, he traveled to his own estate, Kovrinka, and spent three weeks alone. When the weather improved, he went to Borisovka, home of the Pestskys. The journey was enjoyable in the spring weather.

The house at Borisovka was large, with a colonnade and plaster lions. The old English-style park stretched down to the river, inviting visitors to sit and write a ballad. But the gardens and orchards were bright and inspiring, even in bad weather. The flowers were magnificent, and the gardeners were always busy.

Kovrin arrived at Borisovka at nine o'clock, finding Tnya and her father worried about an impending frost. They decided that Tnya would stay up and inspect the gardens, while Yegor Seminovitch would rise early.

Kovrin spent the evening with Tnya and went with her to the garden after midnight. The orchard was filled with smoke to protect the plants from frost. They walked among the trees, and Kovrin enjoyed the sight of Tnya, remembering how she had grown since he last saw her.

He recalled his childhood and felt happiness in the present. Tnya spoke about the monotony of their life, always focused on the garden. Kovrin thought he might fall in love with her during the summer.

The next morning, Yegor Seminovitch showed Kovrin around the garden, explaining everything with enthusiasm. Kovrin felt a youthful joy and embraced the old man. They drank tea together, reminiscing about the past and enjoying the present.

Kovrin worked in the country, but his life remained as busy as in the city. He read, wrote, and studied Italian, always thinking about returning to work. He talked, drank wine, and smoked cigars, but felt exhausted by the music and singing of Tnya and her friends.

One evening, while listening to music, Kovrin remembered a strange legend about a black monk seen as a mirage a thousand years ago. The legend said the mirage would return to earth exactly a thousand years later. The thought intrigued him.

He went for a walk and saw the black monk, just as the legend described. The monk nodded and smiled at him, then disappeared. This experience delighted Kovrin, and he decided to keep it a secret, fearing others would think it a hallucination. That night, he was in high spirits, and Tnya noticed his inspired expression.

When the visitors left, Kovrin went to his room, thinking about the monk. Tnya brought him her father's articles to read, and Yegor Seminovitch expressed hopes for Kovrin and Tnya's relationship. Kovrin found the articles filled with annoyance and irritation, reflecting Yegor Seminovitch's nervous temperament. He thought about Tnya's similar nervousness and felt a strange joy despite the realization that he might be ill.

Yegor Seminovitch and Tnya often quarreled, and Kovrin intervened to make peace. Tnya was upset over a small matter, and Kovrin felt sympathy for her. He realized that the Pestskys were the only people who loved him like family. He comforted Tnya, and she eventually laughed and called herself a fool.

Kovrin was pleased with his success as a peacemaker but felt exhausted by the constant social activities. Visitors came every day, and the house was filled with noise and bustle. Tnya was happy about her romance with Kovrin, though she felt unworthy of him. Yegor Seminovitch was similarly distracted, torn between his work and his daughter's happiness. Kovrin's love for Tnya only fueled his passion for work.

The wedding was celebrated with festivities, but Kovrin was too exhausted to enjoy it fully. He continued to see the black monk, who assured him he was a genius and an exceptional man. This flattery pleased Kovrin, and he believed in his own greatness. He felt that his work was important and that he was serving a higher purpose.

The monk's visits continued, but Kovrin was not frightened. He was convinced that such visions came only to the elect and exceptional. This belief filled him with joy and purpose.

One winter night, Kovrin lay in bed, unable to sleep. The black monk appeared again, and Kovrin discussed happiness with him. Tnya awoke and was terrified to see her husband talking to an invisible figure. She begged him to rest and take care of himself, fearing for his health.

Kovrin realized he was unwell and began treatment. He returned to the country for rest, but the vibrant life he once enjoyed seemed dull. He felt detached and indifferent, longing for something he couldn't define. Tnya noticed his growing irritability and tried to help him, but the tension between him and Yegor Seminovitch grew.

Kovrin's health declined. He began to bleed from the throat and was unable to continue his work. He left Tnya and lived with another woman who cared for him. Despite her efforts, he remained indifferent and resigned to his fate.

In the Crimea, Kovrin was haunted by memories of his past life and the black monk. He received a letter from Tnya, blaming him for her father's death and the ruin of their garden. She cursed him, and he felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and terror.

Kovrin tried to distract himself with work but was unable to concentrate. He longed for the happiness he once felt but knew it was out of reach. The black monk appeared once more, telling him he was a genius and would die because his mortal body could no longer contain his greatness.

Kovrin died with a smile on his face, believing in his own brilliance and the monk's words.

ON THE WAY

In a room called ""The Traveller,"" in an inn, a tall, broad-shouldered man of about forty slept with his head resting on his hands. A young girl, about eight years old, also slept on a bench nearby. The room was dimly lit by a candle, and a storm howled outside.

The man's name was Grigri Petrvitch Likharyff, and he was a brother of a local marshal of the nobility. A woman, Mademoiselle Ilovisky, with sharp features and curly hair, entered the room, seeking shelter from the storm. She was a young woman, dressed in an ulster, and carried a paper parcel.

The girl, Sasha, awoke and complained about her painful shoulder, blaming her father for dragging her through the storm. Likharyff tried to console her, while Mademoiselle Ilovisky watched them with curiosity.

As they talked, Likharyff revealed his past, filled with various infatuations and failures. He had been a Nihilist, a Slavophile, and had even run away to America. He spoke of his love for the Russian people and their language but acknowledged his own shortcomings.

Mademoiselle Ilovisky listened with interest, realizing that Likharyff's words were not just idle talk but a reflection of his beliefs. As he spoke of women and their devotion, she felt drawn to his sincerity and passion.

Likharyff continued to talk about his experiences, his regrets, and his admiration for women's endurance and faithfulness. Mademoiselle Ilovisky was moved by his words and saw in him a man who had truly suffered and understood life.

As morning came, Mademoiselle Ilovisky prepared to leave, but not before expressing her concern for Likharyff's future. She urged him not to go to a desolate coalmining area, knowing it would be a grave for a living man. Likharyff dismissed her warnings, but her sincerity left a lasting impression on him.

As she left, Likharyff stood in the snow, watching her sledge disappear, feeling a sense of connection with her and the world around him.

A FAMILY COUNCIL

The Uskoff family was in turmoil due to Sasha Uskoff's actions. Sasha had forged a bill of exchange and now faced the possibility of being arrested. His uncles were discussing whether to pay the money and save the family's honor or leave Sasha to face the consequences.

Colonel Uskoff argued that family honor should not be falsely understood as protecting a criminal. He believed that the law should take its course. However, the other uncle, an official, was worried about the family's name appearing in the newspapers and suggested hushing up the matter.

Kind-hearted Ivan Markovitch, Sasha's maternal uncle, pleaded for leniency. He argued that Sasha was young and had been deprived of proper guidance. He believed that Sasha had already been punished by his conscience and that mercy should prevail.

Sasha, sitting outside the study, felt indifferent to the outcome. He believed he was not a criminal and that his actions were not unusual among his peers. He felt no fear, shame, or regret.

When Ivan Markovitch brought Sasha into the study, Sasha offered a weak explanation, blaming circumstances for his actions. The uncles were divided in their opinions, but Ivan Markovitch's appeal to family honor and mercy swayed the decision.

In the end, the uncles decided to pay the money, but only if Sasha agreed to repent and go to the country with Ivan Markovitch. Sasha agreed but immediately asked Ivan Markovitch for more money, threatening to forge another bill if he refused.

Sasha walked away with the money, feeling a renewed sense of joy and youth, indifferent to the consequences of his actions.

AT HOME

Yevgni Petrvitch Buikovsky, a district court procurer, returned home to find his son, Serzha, had been caught smoking. The governess was concerned about Serzha's behavior, and Buikovsky decided to talk to him.

Serzha, a delicate and pale boy of seven, admitted to smoking, taking tobacco from his father's table. Buikovsky tried to explain the concept of property and the dangers of smoking, but Serzha was more interested in other things.

As Buikovsky spoke, he realized how difficult it was to instill values and morals in a child. He remembered how smoking was once considered a terrible vice and how children were punished for it without understanding why.

Buikovsky tried to make Serzha understand the importance of respect for others' property and the harm smoking could cause. But Serzha was distracted and uninterested in his father's reasoning.

Eventually, Buikovsky asked Serzha to promise not to smoke again. Serzha agreed but seemed unconvinced. Buikovsky felt that mere words were not enough to reach his son and that the love and understanding of a mother were irreplaceable in raising children.

As Serzha continued to play, Buikovsky realized that truth and morals often needed to be presented in a way that children could understand. He thought of those in authority who used stories and analogies to teach lessons, and how even adults relied on stories and poetry for moral guidance.

Buikovsky decided to tell Serzha a story. The story was about a young prince who smoked and died at a young age, leaving his kingdom without a ruler. Serzha was deeply affected by the tale and promised not to smoke again.

Buikovsky felt he had reached his son, but also recognized the complexity of teaching values and the limitations of logic and reasoning.

IN EXILE

Old Semin, nicknamed Wiseacre, and a young Tartar sat by a bonfire beside a river. The Tartar, sick and tired, talked about his life in Simbirsk and his beautiful wife. Wiseacre, an old man of sixty, was drunk and talked about the harshness of life.

The Tartar was homesick and missed his family. Wiseacre tried to convince him that life would get better and that he would get used to it. Wiseacre shared stories of a gentleman who had come to Siberia and faced hardships, but found solace in his daughter.

The Tartar longed for his wife, even if only for a short time. He believed that even a single day of happiness was better than nothing. Wiseacre told him that wanting nothing was the key to happiness and that he should not listen to the devil's temptations.

The Tartar, trembling from the cold, thought of his family and the life he had left behind. He feared dying in a strange land and being buried in the cold earth. He wished for his wife to come, even if only for a short time.

As dawn approached, the Tartar realized that he was dreaming and that nothing around him was real. The campfire, the river, and the strange people were all part of a dream. He longed to wake up and return to his family in Simbirsk.

He felt the chill of the morning, and the reality of his situation set in. The ferrymen prepared to take people across the river, but the Tartar remained lost in thought. Wiseacre continued to talk about life, but the Tartar was absorbed in his own world of memories and longing.

ROTHSCHILD'S FIDDLE

Yacob Ivanof was a coffin-maker in a small town where people rarely died. Business was bad, and Yacob often lamented the losses he suffered. He also played the fiddle, sometimes joining a Jewish orchestra led by the tinsmith Moses Hitch Shakhkes. Yacob disliked the Jews, especially Rothschild, the flute player.

One day, Yacob's wife, Marfa, fell ill. Yacob was troubled by the thought of her dying on a day when he couldn't work. He took her to the hospital, where the feldscher, Maxim Nikolaitch, diagnosed her with influenza and suggested a cold compress and powders. Yacob wanted her to be bled, but the feldscher refused.

When Marfa died, Yacob made her coffin and recorded the loss in his book. He realized he had never been kind to her and felt guilty. After the funeral, Yacob was overcome with weariness and a sense of loss.

He wandered to the river and thought about his wasted life and all the losses he had endured. He realized he had never really lived, only worried about profits and losses. He felt a sense of despair and hopelessness.

Rothschild, the Jew, approached Yacob, asking for a kopeck. Yacob, feeling disgusted, shouted at him and chased him away. But as he sat by the river, playing his fiddle, he was overcome with emotion. The music reflected his grief and touched Rothschild, who began to cry.

Yacob realized that his fiddle, the only thing that brought him joy, would be left behind when he died. He told the priest to give the fiddle to Rothschild. After Yacob's death, Rothschild took up the fiddle, and his playing, filled with sadness, moved everyone who heard it.

A FATHER

Old Mustoff, a dissipated man, visited his son Boris, asking for ten roubles. Boris silently gave him the money, knowing his father would not repay it. Mustoff admitted to being a liar and a sponger, but Boris forgave him.

Mustoff talked about his life, his love for races, and his winnings. Boris offered to sell him a pair of boots that were too small, and Mustoff agreed. They talked about Mustoff's new rooms and his inability to leave the city due to his wife's refusal.

Boris invited his father to the country for his health, but Mustoff declined, saying his wife's character made it impossible. Mustoff reminisced about his children, praising their virtues and feeling unworthy of them.

As Mustoff and Boris walked to his lodgings, Mustoff continued to talk about his past, his regrets, and his love for his children. Boris listened patiently, forgiving his father for his faults.

When they reached Mustoff's room, his wife was rude and dismissive. Mustoff, trying to maintain his dignity, introduced Boris and offered him a glass of beer. Boris drank in silence, understanding his father's need for companionship.

As Boris prepared to leave, Mustoff broke down, expressing his desire to see his daughter Sonia. Boris promised to arrange a meeting, and Mustoff felt grateful for his son's kindness.

TWO TRAGEDIES

Dr. Kirloff's only son, six-year-old Andrei, died from diphtheria. As Kirloff and his wife mourned, Abgin, a stranger, arrived, begging Kirloff to come and save his dying wife. Kirloff, overwhelmed by grief, refused.

Abgin pleaded with Kirloff, explaining that he had no one else to turn to. Kirloff, though exhausted and indifferent, felt compelled to help. He decided to go with Abgin, leaving his wife alone with their dead child.

Abgin and Kirloff traveled quickly to Abgin's house. Abgin was anxious and grateful, but when they arrived, Kirloff discovered that Abgin's wife had used the pretense of illness to elope with another man.

Abgin was devastated, feeling betrayed and humiliated. He poured out his heart to Kirloff, who listened silently. Kirloff, though initially sympathetic, grew angry at being dragged into Abgin's personal drama. He accused Abgin of mocking his suffering and belittling his own loss.

The two men argued bitterly, each consumed by their own pain and unable to understand the other's perspective. In the end, their conversation only deepened their sense of isolation and despair.

SLEEPYHEAD

Varka, a thirteen-year-old nursemaid, rocked a cradle while murmuring a lullaby. The baby cried incessantly, and Varka, exhausted, wished for sleep. Her head drooped, neck ached, and eyelids were heavy.

As she rocked the cradle, Varka's thoughts drifted to her dead father, Yfim, who had suffered from a rupture. She remembered the doctor visiting their dark cabin and her father's groans. Her mother, Pelageya, had run to the manor-house for help, but Yfim died in the hospital.

Varka was abruptly awakened by her master's slap, reminding her to tend to the child. She resumed her lullaby, but her mind wandered to her father's funeral and her mother's grief.

Throughout the day, Varka worked tirelessly, cleaning the house and preparing meals. Her mind remained clouded with fatigue, and her desire for sleep grew stronger. The master's demands were relentless, and Varka struggled to keep up.

As night fell, Varka continued to rock the cradle, her thoughts consumed by dreams of sleep. She realized that the crying child was the source of her torment and wished for an end to her suffering.

In a moment of desperation, Varka smothered the child and fell asleep on the floor, finally finding peace in her exhaustion.

AT THE MANOR

Pavel Ilitch Rashevitch and his guest, Monsieur Meyer, an examining magistrate, discussed the concept of ""white bones"" and nobility. Rashevitch believed that noble qualities were inherited and that the ""white bone"" represented the best of humanity.

Meyer, a lawyer, listened as Rashevitch expounded on his beliefs. Rashevitch argued that the aristocracy had given the world literature, science, and art, and that the common people could never achieve the same.

Rashevitch's daughters, Zhenya and Iraida, were present at the dinner, but they were bored by their father's endless chatter. They longed for young company and felt frustrated by their isolated life at the manor.

Meyer, who had been visiting the family regularly, was taken aback when Rashevitch's conversation turned to social class. Meyer revealed that he was the son of an artisan, which shocked Rashevitch and embarrassed his daughters.

Meyer left abruptly, and Rashevitch was left to reflect on his words. He realized he had offended Meyer and feared he would never return. Rashevitch's daughters were upset, knowing their father's behavior had driven away the only young man who visited them.

Rashevitch felt ashamed and tormented by his inability to control his words. He was aware of his reputation as a talkative and arrogant man, and his daughters' disappointment only deepened his sense of inadequacy.

AN EVENT

Vanya and Nina, young siblings, awoke to the news that their cat had kittens. They were thrilled and spent the morning playing with the kittens, ignoring their usual routines.

Their excitement was infectious, and they quickly became absorbed in caring for the kittens, planning their future, and building houses for them. The kittens became the center of their world, and they felt a deep sense of happiness.

However, their father soon discovered the kittens and threatened to dispose of them. Vanya and Nina were devastated, but their mother convinced their father to let the kittens stay.

Despite the reprieve, the children were forbidden from visiting the kitchen, where the kittens were kept. They were heartbroken but determined to find a way to see their beloved pets.

They devised a plan to make their dog, Nero, the father of the kittens, hoping it would grant them access to the kitchen. But their plan was foiled when they learned that Nero had eaten the kittens.

Vanya and Nina were inconsolable, and their parents' indifference only added to their grief. Despite their loss, the children remained hopeful, clinging to the belief that they would one day find happiness again.

WARD No. 6

The hospital wing, surrounded by overgrown weeds, housed Ward No. 6. It was a ramshackle building with barred windows and a damp, splintered floor. The patients, dressed in blue dressing-gowns and nightcaps, lived in squalor and isolation.

Among the patients was Ivn Dmtritch Gromof, a former official suffering from the mania of persecution. He was a thoughtful and intelligent man but tormented by his condition. His fellow patients included a Jew named Mosika, a paralytic, a fat muzhik, and a former postal sorter.

Gromof was always in a state of agitation, fearing arrest and imprisonment. He had once been a promising student, but misfortunes had led to his downfall. His father's disgrace, his mother's death, and his own failures had driven him to madness.

The hospital was in a state of neglect, with the staff indifferent to the patients' suffering. Dr. Andri Yfimitch Rgin, the hospital's head doctor, was a man of intellect but lacked the will to effect change. He was disillusioned with the medical profession and indifferent to the hospital's conditions.

Dr. Rgin spent most of his time reading and reflecting on life. He admired intellect and honesty but felt powerless to improve his surroundings. He believed that suffering was an inevitable part of life and questioned the value of alleviating it.

One day, Dr. Rgin visited Ward No. 6 and engaged in conversation with Gromof. The two men discussed intellectual and philosophical topics, finding solace in their shared understanding. Dr. Rgin was drawn to Gromof's intelligence and began visiting him regularly.

The visits raised suspicions among the hospital staff, who questioned Dr. Rgin's sanity. Despite the rumors, Dr. Rgin found comfort in his conversations with Gromof, who challenged his beliefs and offered a fresh perspective on life.

As Dr. Rgin spent more time in the ward, he became increasingly isolated from the outside world. His friendship with Gromof deepened, and he found himself questioning his own life and values.

In the end, Dr. Rgin's visits to Ward No. 6 led to his downfall. He was declared insane and committed to the very ward he had once overseen. His life ended in despair, but he found solace in the knowledge that he had connected with a kindred spirit in Gromof.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"In the story of Andrei Vasilyevitch Kovrin, the central conflict revolves around Kovrin's internal struggle with his mental health and the hallucinations of the black monk, which symbolize his descent into madness. Initially, Kovrin is a successful scholar who experiences stress and exhaustion from his work. His journey to the countryside, meant to provide rest and recovery, instead leads him to encounter the black monk—a manifestation of his genius and madness.

Kovrin's interactions with the monk become a source of both inspiration and delusion. The monk's flattery convinces Kovrin of his own greatness, fueling his work and sense of purpose, but also distancing him from reality and those around him, including Tnya and her father, Yegor Seminovitch. This conflict between his perceived brilliance and the deteriorating state of his mental health leads to a series of personal and relational breakdowns.

The dilemma intensifies as Kovrin struggles to reconcile his visions with the concerns of those who love him. His belief in the monk's words ultimately leads to his physical and emotional deterioration, culminating in his death.

085.txt,"""Tell me what time is,"" Harrigan said one late summer afternoon at a bar on Madison Street. ""I'd like to know.""

""It's a dimension,"" I replied. ""Everyone knows that.""

""Okay, fair enough. I know space is a dimension and you can move forward or backward in space. And, of course, you keep getting older all the time.""

""That's basic stuff,"" I said.

""But what happens if you can move backward or forward in time? Do you age or get younger, or do you stay the same?""

""I'm not an expert on time, Tex. Do you know anyone who traveled in time?""

Harrigan brushed off my question. ""That's also what I couldn't get out of Vanderkamp. He thought he knew everything else.""

""Vanderkamp?""

""He was another one of those strange people a reporter always meets. Lived in New York—downtown, near the Bowery. Man of about forty, I'd say, but a bit old-fashioned. Dutch background, and obsessed with New Amsterdam, which, in case you don't know, was the original name of New York City.""

""Don't mind my interrupting,"" I cut in. ""But I'm not quite clear on what Vanderkamp has to do with time as a dimension.""

""Oh, he was obsessed with the subject. He claimed he could travel in it. In fact, he said he invented a time-traveling machine.""

""You certainly meet some odd folks, Tex!""

""Don't I!"" He grinned and leaned back over the bar. ""But Vanderkamp had the wildest dreams of them all. And in the end, he did the neatest trick of them all. I was working for the Brooklyn Enterprise back then; I spent about a year there. I was doing special features, though I was paid as a reporter. Vanderkamp was sort of a local celebrity in a small way; he wrote articles about the early Dutch in New York, the names of Dutch places, and the like. He was good with a pen, and even better with tools. He was an amateur electrician, carpenter, house-painter, and claimed to be an expert in family trees.""

""And he built a time-traveling machine?""

""So he said. He gave me a pretty hard time. He was a smooth talker, and half the time I didn't know if I was coming or going. He kept me on my toes by assuming that I accepted his basic ideas. I got a lead on him from a tip. He could be as quiet as a clam, but his sister let things slip from time to time, and on this occasion, she told one of her friends in a grocery store that her brother had invented a machine that took him on trips into the past. It seemed like routine crazy stuff, but Blake, who decided what went into the Enterprise and what didn't, sent me over to Manhattan to get something for the paper, on the theory that since Vanderkamp was well-known in Brooklyn, it was good neighborhood copy.

""Vanderkamp was a sharp-eyed little fellow, about five feet tall, and I caught him at a good time. His sister said he had just come back from a trip—she left me to guess what kind of trip—and I found him in a mild fit of temper. He was too upset, in fact, to be grumpy, which was more his nature.

""Was it true, I wanted to know, that he'd invented a machine that traveled in time?

""He didn't hide it. 'Certainly,' he said. 'I've been using it for the last month, and if my sister hadn't decided to blab, nobody would know about it yet. What about it?'

""'You believe it can take you backwards or forwards into the past or the future?'

""'Do I look crazy? I said so, didn't I?'

""Now, as a matter of fact, he did look crazy. Unlike most of the people for my file of odd folks, Vanderkamp actually looked like a nut. He had wild eyes and a constantly moving mouth; he blinked a lot and stammered when he was excited. In features, he was as Dutch as his name implied. Well, we talked back and forth for some time, but I stuck with him and in the end, he took me out to a shed next to his house and showed me the contraption he'd built.

""It looked like a top. The first thing I thought of was Brick Bradford, and before I could stop myself, I asked, 'Is that pure Brick Bradford?'

""He didn't even flinch. 'Not by a long shot,' he answered. 'H. G. Wells was there first. I owe it to Wells.'

""'I see,' I said.

""'The heck you do!' he shot back. 'You think I'm as nutty as a fruitcake.'

""'The idea of time travel is a little hard to believe,' I said.

""'Sure it is. But me, I'm doing it. So that's all there is to it.'

""'If you don't mind, Mr. Vanderkamp,' I said, 'I'm not very smart about scientific stuff. I have all I can do to tell a nut from a bolt.'

""'That I believe,' he said.

""'So how do you time travel?'

""'Look,' he said, 'time is a dimension like space. You can go up or down this ruler,' he grabbed a steel ruler and waved it in front of me, 'from any given point. But you move. In the dimension of time, you only seem to move. You stand still; time moves. Do you get it?'

""I had to confess that I didn't.

""He tried again, with obviously strained patience. Judging by what I could gather from what he said, it was possible for him—so he believed—to get into his machine, twirl a few knobs, push a few buttons, relax for any given period, and end up just where he liked—back in the past, or ahead in the future. But wherever he ended up, he was still in the same spot. In other words, whether he was back in 1492 or ahead in 2092, the place he got out of his time machine was still his present address.

""It was beyond me, frankly, but I figured that as long as he was a little touched, it wouldn't do any harm to humor him. I hinted that I understood and asked him where he'd been last.

""His face fell, his brow clouded, and he said, 'I've been ahead thirty years.' He shook his head angrily. 'What a time! I'll be seventy, and you won't even be that, Mr. Harrigan. But we'll be in the middle of the worst atomic war you ever dreamed about.'

""Now this was before Hiroshima, quite a bit. I didn't know what he was talking about, but it gives me a strange feeling now and then when I think of what he said, especially since it's still short of thirty years since that time.

""'It's no time to be living here,' he went on. 'Direct hits on the entire area. What would you do?'

""'I'd get out,' I said.

""'That's what I thought,' he said. 'But that kind of warfare carries a long way. A long way. And I'm a man who loves his comforts, reasonably. I don't intend to set up housekeeping in equatorial Africa or the forests of Brazil.'

""'What did you see thirty years from now, Mr. Vanderkamp?' I asked him.

""'Everything blown to bits,' he answered. 'Not a building in all Manhattan.' He grinned and added, 'And everybody who'll be living here at that time will be scattered into the atmosphere in fragments no bigger than an amoeba.'

""'You fill me with anticipation,' I said.

""So I went back to my desk and wrote the story. You could guess what kind it had to be. 'Time Travel Is Possible, Says Amateur Scientist!'—that kind of thing. You can see it every week, in large doses, in the feature sections of some of the biggest chain papers. It went over like an average feature about life on the moon or prehistoric animals surviving in remote mountain valleys, or what have you. Just what Vanderkamp went back to after I left, I don't know, but I have an idea that he gave his sister a devil of a time.""

* * *

Vanderkamp walked into the house and confronted his sister.

""You see, Julie—a reporter. Can't you learn to keep quiet?""

She gave him a scornful look. ""What difference does it make?"" she shouted. ""You're gone all the time.""

""Maybe I'll take you along sometime. Just wait.""

""Wait, wait! That's all I've been doing. Since I was ten years old I've been waiting on you!""

""Oh, forget it!"" He turned on his heel and left the house.

She followed him to the door and yelled after him, ""Where are you going now?""

""To New Amsterdam for a little peace and quiet,"" he said testily.

He opened the thick door of his time-machine and shut it behind him. He sat down before the controls and began to chart his course for 1650. If his calculations were correct, he would soon find himself near that sturdy if autocratic first citizen of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, as well as Governor Stuyvesant's friend and neighbor, Heinrich Vanderkamp. He didn't even look back before he started out.

When he emerged from his machine, he was in what looked like the backyard of a modest house on a street which he suspected might be the Bouwerie. At the moment of his emergence, a tall, angular woman stood watching him, open-mouthed and shocked, from the wooden porch at the back door of her home. He looked at her in surprise himself. The resemblance to his sister Julie was uncanny.

With only the slightest hesitation, he addressed her in fluent Dutch. ""Please don't be alarmed, young lady.""

""A fine way for a gentleman to call!"" she exclaimed in a voice much stronger than her appearance. ""I suppose my father sent you. And where did you get that strange outfit?""

""I bought it,"" he answered, truthfully enough.

""A likely story,"" she said. ""And if my father sent you, just go back and tell him I'm satisfied the way I am. No woman needs a man to manage her.""

""I don't have the honor of knowing your father,"" he answered.

She looked at him suspiciously with narrowed eyes. ""Everyone in New Amsterdam knows Henrik Van Tromp. He's as unpopular as a bumblebee. Stand where you are and say where you came from.""

""I am a visitor in New Amsterdam,"" he said, standing obediently still. ""I admit I don't know my way around very well, and I chose to stop at this attractive home.""

""I know it's attractive,"" she said sharply. ""And it's clear you're a stranger here, or you'd never be wearing such clothes. Or is it the fashion where you come from?"" She gave him no chance to answer, but added, after a moment of hesitation, ""Well, you look respectable enough, though much like my troublesome cousin Pieter Vanderkamp. Do you know him?""

""No.""

""Well, no matter. He's much older than you—close to forty blessed years. You're no more than twenty, I don't doubt.""

Involuntarily Vanderkamp put his hand to his cheek and smiled as he felt its smooth roundness. ""You may be right, at that,"" he said cryptically.

""You might as well come in,"" she said grudgingly. ""What with the traffic on the road outside, the Indians, and people who come in such strange vehicles as yours, I might as well live in the heart of the colony.""

He looked around. ""And still,"" he said, ""it is a pleasant spot—peaceful, comfortable. I'm sure a man could live out his days here in contentment.""

""Oh, could he?"" she said belligerently. ""And where would I be while this was happening?""

He gazed at her sharp nose, her jutting chin. ""A good question,"" he muttered thoughtfully.

He followed her into the house. It was a treasure of old things, filling him with delight. Miss Anna Van Tromp offered him a cup of milk, which he accepted, thanking her profusely. She talked a lot, eyeing him all the while with the utmost curiosity, and he gathered that her father had made several attempts to marry her off, disapproving of her living alone so far from the center of the city; but she had frowned upon all the suitors he had encouraged to call on her. She was undeniably impressive, almost formidable, he conceded privately, with a touch of the shrew and harridan. Life with Miss Anna Van Tromp would not be easy, he reflected. But then, life with his sister Julie was not easy, either. Miss Anna, however, had not to face atomic warfare; all she had to look forward to in fourteen years was surrender to the besieging British, which she would have no trouble in surviving.

He settled down to be as charming as possible and succeeded in making a very good impression on Miss Anna Van Tromp before he finally took his leave, carrying with him a fine, hand-crafted bowl that she had given him. He had a feeling he might come back. Of all the times he had visited since finishing the machine, he knew that old New Amsterdam in the 1650s was the one period most likely to keep him contented—provided Miss Van Tromp didn't become a bother. So he took careful note of the settings on his controls, jotting them down so that he wouldn't forget them.

It was late when he returned to his own time.

His sister was waiting up for him. ""Two o'clock in the morning!"" she yelled at him. ""What are you doing to me? Oh, God, why didn't I marry when I had the chance, instead of wasting my life on a worthless brother!""

""Why don't you? It's not too late,"" he sighed wearily.

""How can you say that?"" she snapped bitterly. ""Here I am nearly thirty, and worn out from working for you. Who would marry me now? Oh, if only I could have another chance! If I could be young again, and do it all over, I'd know how to have a better life!""

Despite his boredom with her, Vanderkamp felt the impact of this cry from a lonely heart. He looked at her pityingly; it was true, after all, that she had worked faithfully for him, without pay, since their parents died. ""Take a look at this,"" he said gently, offering her the bowl.

""Hah! Can we eat bowls?""

He raised his eyes to the sky and went wearily to bed.

* * *

""I saw Vanderkamp again about two weeks later,"" Harrigan continued. ""Ran into him in a bar on the Bowery. He recognized me and came over.

""'That was some story you did,' he said.

""'Been bothered by cranks?' I asked.

""'Hell, yes! Not too badly, though. They want to ride off somewhere just to get away. I get that feeling myself sometimes. But, tell me, have you seen the morning papers?'

""Now, by coincidence, the papers that morning had carried a story from some local nuclear physicist about the increasing probability that the atom would be smashed. I told him I'd seen it.

""'What did I tell you?' he said.

""I just smiled and asked where he'd been lately. He didn't hesitate to talk, perhaps because his sister had been giving him a hard time with her nagging. So I listened. It appeared, to hear him tell it, that he had been off visiting the Dutch in New Amsterdam. You could almost believe what he said, listening to him, except for that wild look he had. Anyway, he'd been in New Amsterdam about 1650, and he'd brought back a few small souvenirs of the trips. Would I like to see them? I said I would.

""I figured he'd got his hands on some nice antiques and wanted an appreciative audience. His sister wasn't home; so he took me around and showed me his pieces, one by one—a bowl, a pair of wooden candlesticks, wooden shoes, and more, all in all a fine collection. He even had a chair that looked pretty authentic, and I wondered where he'd dug up so many nice things of the New Amsterdam period—though, of course, I had to take his word as to where they belonged historically; I didn't know. But I imagine he got them somewhere in the city or perhaps up in the Catskill country.

""Well, after a while I got another look at his contraption. It didn't appear to have been moved at all; it was still sitting where it had been before, without a sign to say that it had been used to go anywhere, least of all into past time.

""'Tell me,' I said to him at last, 'when you go back in time do you get younger?'

""'Yes and no,' he said. 'Obviously.'

""It wasn't obvious to me, but I couldn't get any more than that out of him. The thing I couldn't figure out was the reason for his claim. He wasn't trying to sell anything to anybody, as far as I could see; he wasn't anxious to tell the world about his time-machine, either. He didn't mind talking in his roundabout way about his trips. He did talk about New Amsterdam as if he had a pretty good acquaintance with the place. But then, he was known as a minor authority on the customs of the Dutch colony.

""He was touched, obviously. Just the same, he challenged me, in a way. I wanted to know something more about him, how his machine worked, how he took off, and so on. I made up my mind the next time I was in the neighborhood to look him up, hoping he wouldn't be home.

""When I made it, his sister was alone, and in a fine mood, as cranky as a flea-bitten dog.

""'He's gone again,' she complained bitterly.

""Clearly the two of them were at odds. I asked her whether she had seen him go. She hadn't; he had just marched out to his shop and that was an end to him as far as she was concerned.

""I haggled around quite a lot and finally got her permission to go out and see what I could see for myself. Of course, the shop was locked. I had counted on that and had brought along a handy little skeleton key. I was inside in no time. The machine wasn't there. Not a sign of it, or of Vanderkamp either.

""Now, I looked around all over, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how he could have taken it out of that place; it was too big for doors or windows, and the walls and roof were solid and immovable. I figured that he couldn't have got such a large machine away without his sister seeing him; so I locked the place up and went back to the house.

""But she was immovable; she hadn't seen a thing. If he had taken anything larger than pocket-size out of that shop of his, she had missed it. I could hardly doubt her sincerity. There was nothing to be had from that source; so I had no alternative but to wait for him another time.""

* * *

Anna Van Tromp, considerably subdued, watched her strange suitor—she thought of all men as suitors, without exception; for so her father had taught her to do—as he reached into his sack and brought out another wonder.

""Now this,"" said Vanderkamp, ""is an alarm clock. You wind it up like this, you see; set it, and off it goes. Listen to it ring! That will wake you up in the morning.""

""More magic,"" she cried doubtfully.

""No, no,"" he explained patiently. ""It is an everyday thing in my country. Perhaps some day you would like to join me in a little visit there, Anna?""

""Ja, maybe,"" she agreed, looking out the window at his strange and frightening carriage, which had no animal to draw it and which vanished so strangely, fading away into the air, whenever Vanderkamp went into it. ""This clothes-washing machine you talk about,"" she admitted. ""This I would like to see.""

""I must go now,"" said Vanderkamp, gazing at her with a well-acted shyness. ""I'll leave these things here with you, and I'll just take along that bench over there.""

""Ja, ja,"" said Anna, blushing.

""Six of one and half a dozen of the other,"" muttered Vanderkamp, comparing Anna with his sister.

He got into his time-machine and set out for home in the twentieth century. There was some reluctance in his going. Here all was peaceful and quiet, despite the hardships of living; in his own time there were wars and turmoil and the ultimate threat of the greatest war of all. New Amsterdam had one drawback, however—the presence of Anna Von Tromp. She had grown fond of him, undeniably, perhaps because he was so much more interested in her circumstances than in herself. What was a man to do? Julie at one end, Anna at the other. But even getting rid of Julie wouldn't allow him to escape the war to come.

He thought deeply about his problem the whole way home.

When he got back, he found his sister waiting up, as usual, ready to deliver the usual lecture.

He stopped her. ""I've been thinking things over, Julie. I believe you'd be much happier if you were living with brother Carl. I'll give you as much money as you need, and you can pack your things and I'll take you down to Louisiana.""

""Take me!"" she exclaimed. ""How? In that crazy contraption of yours?""

""Precisely.""

""Oh no!"" she said. ""You won't get me into that machine! How do I know what it will do to me? It's a time machine, isn't it? It might make an old hag of me—or a baby!""

""You said that you wanted to be young again, didn't you?"" he said softly. ""You said you'd like another chance....""

A faraway look came into her eyes. ""Oh, if I only could! If I only could be a girl again, with a chance to get married....""

""Pack your things,"" Vanderkamp said quietly.

* * *

""It must have been all of a month before I saw Vanderkamp again,"" Harrigan continued, waving for another scotch and soda. ""I was down in the area on an assignment and I took a run over to his place.

""He was home this time. He came to the door, which he had chained on the inside. He recognized me, and it was clear at the same time that he had no intention of letting me in.

""I came right out with the first question I had in mind. 'The thing that bothers me,' I said to him, 'is how you get that time machine of yours in and out of that shed.'

""'Mr. Harrigan,' he answered, 'newspaper reporters ought to have at least basic scientific knowledge. You don't. How in the world could even a time machine be in two places at once, I ask you? If I take that machine back three centuries, that's where it is—not here. And three centuries ago that shop wasn't standing there. So you don't go in or out; you don't move at all, remember? It's time that moves.'

""'I called the other day,' I went on. 'Your sister spoke to me. Give her my regards.'

""'My sister's left me,' he said shortly, 'to stew, as you might say, in my own time machine.'

""'Really?' I said. 'Just what do you have in mind to do next?'

""'Let me ask you something, Mr. Harrigan,' he answered. 'Would you sit around here waiting for an atomic war if you could get away?'

""'Certainly not,' I answered.

""'Well, then, I don't intend to, either.'

""All this while he was standing at the door, refusing to open it any wider or to let me in. He was making it pretty clear that there wasn't much he had to say to me. And he seemed to be in a hurry.

""'Remember me to the curious public thirty years from now, Mr. Harrigan,' he said at last, and closed the door.

""That was the last I saw of him.""

Harrigan finished his scotch and soda appreciatively and looked around for the bartender.

""Did he take off then?"" I asked.

""Like a rocket,"" said Harrigan. ""The strangest thing was that there wasn't a trace of him. The machine was gone, too—the same way as the last time, without a disturbance in the shop. He and his machine had simply vanished off the face of the earth and were never heard from again.

""Matter of fact, though,"" Harrigan went on thoughtfully, ""Vanderkamp's disappearance wasn't the really strange part of the story. The other thing broke in the papers the week after he left. The neighbors got pretty worked up about it. They called the police to tell them that Vanderkamp's sister Julie was back, only she was off her rocker—and a good deal changed in appearance, too.

""Gal going crazy was no news, of course, but that last bit about her appearance—they said she looked about twenty years older, all of a sudden—sort of rang a bell. So I went over there. It was Julie, all right; at least, she looked a lot like Julie had when I last saw her—provided you could believe that a woman could age twenty years in the few weeks it had been. And she was off her rocker, sure enough—or hysterical. Or at least madder than a wet hen. She made out like she couldn't speak a word of English, and they had to get an interpreter to understand her. She wouldn't speak anything but Dutch—and an old-fashioned kind, too.

""She made a lot of wild claims and kept insisting that she would bring the whole matter up in a complaint before Governor Stuyvesant. Said she wasn't Julie Vanderkamp, by God, but was named Anna Van Tromp—which is an old Dutch name thereabouts—and claimed that she had been taken from her home on the Bowery. We pointed out the Third Avenue El and told her that was the Bowery, but she just sniffed and looked at us as though we were crazy.""

I toyed with my drink. ""You mean you actually listened to the poor woman's story?"" I asked.

""Sure,"" Harrigan said. ""Maybe she was as crazy as a bedbug, but I've listened to stranger stories from supposedly sane people. Sure, I listened to her."" He paused thoughtfully for a moment, then continued.

""She claimed that this fellow Vanderkamp had come to her house and filled her with a lot of nonsense about the wonderful country he lived in, and how she ought to let him take her to see it. Apparently he talked a lot about an automatic washing-machine and dryer, and that had fascinated her, for some reason. Then, she said, he'd brought a ten-year-old girl along—though where in the world old Vanderkamp could have picked up a kid like that is beyond me—and the kid had helped convince her. Between them, they had managed to get her into the old guy's machine. From what she said, it was obviously the time machine she was talking about, and if she was Julie there was no reason why she shouldn't know about it. But she talked as though it was a complete mystery to her, as though she had no idea what it was for. Well, anyway, here she was—and very unhappy, too. Wanted to go back to old New Amsterdam, but badly.

""It was a beautiful act, even if she was nuts. The strange thing was, though, that there were some things even a crazy woman couldn't explain. For instance, the house was filled with what the experts said were priceless antiques from Dutch New Amsterdam, of the period just before the British siege. You'd think those things would make poor Julie feel more at home, seeing as she claimed to belong in that period, but apparently they just made her homesick. And, curiously enough, all the modern gadgets were gone. All those handy little items that make the twentieth century so livable had been taken away—including the washing-machine and dryer, by the way. Julie—or Anna, as she called herself—claimed that Vanderkamp had taken it back with him, wherever he'd gone to, after he'd brought her there.""

""Poor woman,"" I said sympathetically. ""They took her off to the mental hospital, I suppose.""

""No...."" Harrigan said slowly. ""They didn't, as a matter of fact. Since she was harmless, they let her stay in the house a while. Which was a mistake, it seems. Of course, she wasn't from the seventeenth century. That's impossible. All the same—."" He broke off abruptly and stared moodily into his glass.

""What happened to her?"" I asked.

""She was found one morning about two weeks after she got there,"" he said. ""Dead. Electrocuted. It seems she'd stuck her finger into a light socket while standing in a bathtub full of water. An accident, obviously. As the Medical Examiner said, it was an accident any six-year-old child would have known enough about electricity to avoid.

""That is,"" Harrigan added, ""a twentieth-century child....""",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in the story revolves around the concept of time travel and its implications on identity, reality, and the consequences of altering one's timeline. Vanderkamp, who claims to have invented a time-traveling machine, is able to move through time, but his actions lead to significant consequences for himself and those around him. The story explores the tension between the allure of escaping the present—especially to avoid an impending atomic war—and the complications and ethical dilemmas that arise from meddling with the past or future.

Vanderkamp's interactions with his sister Julie, his encounters in the past with Anna Van Tromp, and his ultimate disappearance underscore the personal and existential conflicts of living with knowledge of a potentially disastrous future and the desire to find peace in a different time. The story raises questions about the nature of time as a dimension, the possibility of changing one's fate, and the unforeseen consequences of such changes, as evidenced by the mysterious transformation and tragic fate of Julie/Anna.","Would you leave everything behind to escape an atomic war, even if it meant traveling to a time you've never known?","If you discovered a way to escape a doomed future, would you leave your loved ones behind?",What if traveling back in time meant losing your identity—would you take the chance to change your fate?,science fiction,tragedy,coming of age,Who claimed to have invented a time-traveling machine?,Vanderkamp claimed to have invented a time-traveling machine.,Why did Vanderkamp want to travel to the past?,Vanderkamp wanted to travel to the past to escape the future atomic war he foresaw and to find peace and quiet in a time he found more appealing.,What might happen if someone from the past suddenly appeared in the present?,"If someone from the past suddenly appeared in the present, they might be confused by modern technology and culture, and they could struggle to adapt to the new environment, much like Anna Van Tromp did.",How does the story explore the concept of time as a dimension?,"The story explores time as a dimension by presenting Vanderkamp's belief that time can be navigated like space, allowing movement to the past or future.

086.txt,"Once upon a time, whether it was in the past or the future doesn’t really matter, the world was filled with so much old junk that people decided to have a huge bonfire to get rid of it all. They chose a big open prairie in the West so the fire wouldn’t threaten any houses, and lots of people could watch. I decided to go because I was curious to see what truths the fire might reveal.

When I got there, the pile of stuff to be burned was still pretty small, but the fire had already been started. In the middle of the vast plain, it was just a tiny flicker at first, but more and more people kept bringing things to burn. There were women with aprons full of stuff, men on horses, people with wheelbarrows and wagons, all loaded with things that were only good for burning.

I asked a man standing nearby how they started the fire. He was about fifty, seemed very serious, and looked like he didn’t care much about what other people thought. He told me they used old newspapers, last month’s magazines, and dry leaves to get it going. As he spoke, some rough men threw in all the old papers from the herald’s office, like family crests and coats of arms, and badges from knights and nobles.

The crowd cheered as these symbols of old power went up in flames, celebrating the downfall of those who thought they were better than everyone else. But then a stately old man rushed forward, clearly upset by what he saw. He tried to argue that these symbols of nobility had preserved the best parts of society, like art and chivalry, but the crowd drowned him out with laughter and he slunk back, defeated.

Nearby, some temperance activists, led by Father Mathew, rolled barrels of alcohol to the fire. They watched as the flames soared, freeing the world from the curse of liquor. But not everyone was happy. Some people, like old drinkers, lamented that without alcohol, the world would be a colder, sadder place.

Then, groups came from all over to throw in more things. There were barrels of tea and coffee, and crops of tobacco, which made the air thick with smoke. People tossed in old love letters, political papers, and even fashion items like last season’s bonnets. Some threw in playthings and diplomas, as if rejecting the past entirely. An American author even threw in his pen, giving up on writing.

Next came weapons and war gear, even royal crowns and robes, all deemed unnecessary in a peaceful world. The crowd rejoiced at the idea of eternal peace, though a skeptical old soldier doubted war could truly end.

The fire continued to burn brightly as religious symbols and books were added, pushing the idea of reform even further. Some worried that without these, the world might lose important values. Yet others believed that what truly mattered would survive the flames, unchanged.

In the end, my companion suggested that despite the fire’s destruction, the essence of what was important would remain. He believed that when the ashes settled, the world would reclaim its valuable truths and continue on, hopefully wiser from the experience.

As morning approached, I realized that while the fire had consumed much, the human heart, with all its flaws and hopes, had not been changed. The real challenge lay in purifying our hearts, as only then would we see true and lasting change in the world.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around the tension between the desire to discard the past and the fear of losing valuable elements of history and culture. The massive bonfire symbolizes a radical attempt to cleanse the world of its ""old junk,"" including societal symbols, substances like alcohol, and cultural artifacts. This act of destruction is met with a mix of enthusiasm and resistance. On one side, the crowd celebrates the shedding of outdated or oppressive elements, while on the other, individuals express concern over the loss of traditions, values, and the essence of society.

The dilemma lies in determining what should be preserved and what should be discarded. It questions whether the act of burning away the past can truly lead to a purified, more enlightened world, or if it risks erasing parts of our identity and wisdom. Ultimately, the story suggests that external change is not enough; the true transformation must occur within the human heart, highlighting the ongoing struggle between progress and preservation.","As religious books turn to ash, do you believe the world will be better, or are important values slipping away?","Would you cheer as old symbols of power burn, or worry about losing history forever?","If you could erase war by tossing weapons into a fire, would you do it, even if peace sounds like a dream?",fantasy,tragedy,good vs. evil,What did people decide to do with all the old junk in the world?,People decided to have a huge bonfire to get rid of all the old junk in the world.,Why did the crowd cheer when old symbols of power were burned?,The crowd cheered because they saw the burning of old symbols of power as a celebration of the downfall of those who thought they were better than everyone else.,What might happen if people today decided to burn old symbols of power?,"If people today decided to burn old symbols of power, it might lead to a debate about the value and meaning of those symbols, and whether their destruction would truly lead to positive change or just erase important parts of history.",What does the fire symbolize in the story?,"The fire symbolizes a desire for change and purification, as people attempt to rid the world of outdated or harmful elements.

088.txt,"A green and yellow parrot sat in a cage outside the door, repeating over and over, ""Go away! Go away! That's all right!"" He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language nobody understood, except maybe the mockingbird on the other side of the door, whistling with annoying persistence. 

Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper comfortably, got up with an expression of disgust. He walked down the gallery and across the narrow walkways connecting the Lebrun cottages. He had been sitting in front of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were Madame Lebrun's pets, and they could make all the noise they wanted. Mr. Pontellier had the option to leave when they stopped being entertaining.

He stopped at his own cottage, which was the fourth from the main building and next to the last. Sitting in a wicker rocker, he went back to his newspaper. It was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers hadn't reached Grand Isle yet. He already knew the market reports and glanced restlessly over the editorials and news bits he hadn't read before leaving New Orleans the day before.

Mr. Pontellier wore glasses. He was a man of forty, medium height, and rather slender; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly trimmed. 

Occasionally, he looked around him. There was more noise than ever at the house. The main building was called ""the house"" to distinguish it from the cottages. The birds were still chattering and whistling. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a piano duet. Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high voice. She was a pretty woman, always in white with elbow sleeves. Her skirts crinkled as she moved. Farther down, a lady in black was walking up and down, saying her prayers. Many people had gone to Cheniere Caminada to hear mass. Some young people were playing croquet under the oaks. Mr. Pontellier's two children were there—sturdy little boys of four and five. Their nurse followed them with a faraway, thoughtful air.

Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag from his hand. He watched a white sunshade moving slowly from the beach. He could see it between the oak trunks and across the yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, blending into the horizon. The sunshade approached slowly. Beneath it were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, they sat on the porch steps, facing each other, leaning against the posts.

“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier. He had taken a plunge at daylight, which made the morning seem long to him.

“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife like she was a valuable piece of property damaged. She held up her hands, strong and shapely, and looked at them critically, pulling up her sleeves. She remembered her rings, given to her husband before going to the beach. She silently reached out, and he, understanding, took the rings from his pocket and dropped them into her palm. She slipped them on, then clasped her knees and laughed with Robert. The rings sparkled. He smiled back.

“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily amused. It was some nonsense, some adventure in the water, and they tried to tell it at once. It wasn't as amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and stretched. Then he got up, saying he might go to Klein's hotel to play billiards.

“Come, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert said he preferred to stay and talk to Mrs. Pontellier.

“Well, send him away when he bores you, Edna,” instructed her husband as he left.

“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out. He accepted it, lifted it over his head, and walked away.

“Coming back for dinner?” his wife called after him. He shrugged. He felt in his pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill. Maybe he'd return for dinner, maybe not. It depended on the company at Klein's and the size of the game. He didn't say this, but she understood and laughed, nodding goodbye.

Both children wanted to follow their father. He kissed them and promised to bring bonbons and peanuts.

CHAPTER II

Mrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright, a yellowish brown, like her hair. She turned them swiftly on objects, as if lost in thought.

Her eyebrows were darker than her hair, thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing her eyes' depth. She was more handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating because of its frankness and subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.

Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he couldn't afford cigars, though he had one Mr. Pontellier gave him, saving it for after dinner.

This seemed proper. In coloring, he was like his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced. No shadow of care rested on his open face. His eyes reflected the summer day's light and languor.

Mrs. Pontellier took a palm-leaf fan from the porch and began to fan herself while Robert smoked. They chatted about things around them, their water adventure, the wind, the trees, the people at the Cheniere, the children playing croquet, and the Farival twins playing “The Poet and the Peasant.”

Robert talked a lot about himself. He was young and didn't know better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason. Each was interested in the other. Robert spoke of going to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him. He always intended to go to Mexico but never did. Meanwhile, he held a position in a New Orleans mercantile house, where his familiarity with English, French, and Spanish made him valuable.

He spent his summer vacation at Grand Isle with his mother. Before Robert could remember, “the house” was a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, with its cottages filled with visitors from the “Quartier Francais,” it let Madame Lebrun live comfortably.

Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in Kentucky. She was an American woman with a small bit of French in her background, which seemed diluted. She read a letter from her sister, who was engaged to be married. Robert was interested and wanted to know what the sisters were like, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.

When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter, it was time for her to dress for dinner.

“I see Leonce isn't coming back,” she said, glancing where he had left. Robert supposed he wasn't, as there were club men at Klein's.

When Mrs. Pontellier left, Robert strolled toward the croquet players, amusing himself with the Pontellier children, who liked him.

CHAPTER III

Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein's hotel at eleven o'clock that night. He was in a good mood, talkative. His entrance woke his wife, who was asleep. He talked while undressing, telling anecdotes and gossip. From his pockets, he took crumpled bank notes and silver coins, piling them on the bureau with keys, a knife, and whatever else was in his pockets. She was sleepy and answered with little utterances.

He thought it discouraging that his wife, the sole object of his existence, showed little interest in things concerning him.

Mr. Pontellier forgot bonbons and peanuts for the boys. Though he loved them, he went to their room to check on them. The result was unsatisfactory. He turned them in bed. One kicked and talked about a basket of crabs.

Mr. Pontellier returned, saying Raoul had a fever and needed attention. Then he lit a cigar and sat near the open door to smoke.

Mrs. Pontellier was sure Raoul had no fever. He went to bed well, she said. Mr. Pontellier assured her the child was feverish.

He reproached his wife for her inattention and neglect of the children. If it wasn't a mother's place to look after children, whose was it? He had his brokerage business. He couldn't be in two places at once; making a living and staying home to ensure no harm came to them. He talked monotonously.

Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went to the next room. She soon returned and sat on the bed, leaning her head on the pillow. She said nothing, refusing to answer her husband. When his cigar was out, he went to bed and was soon asleep.

Mrs. Pontellier was then fully awake. She began to cry, wiping her eyes on her sleeve. Blowing out the candle, she slipped her feet into satin slippers and went to the porch, where she sat in a wicker chair and began to rock.

It was past midnight. The cottages were dark. A faint light gleamed from the house hallway. There was no sound except an owl hooting and the sea's voice, like a lullaby.

Tears came so fast that her sleeve no longer dried them. She held the chair's back with one hand, her sleeve slipping to her shoulder. Turning, she thrust her face into her arm, crying without caring to dry her face, eyes, or arms. She couldn't have said why she was crying. Such experiences were common in her married life. They seemed never to weigh much against her husband's kindness and devotion.

An indescribable oppression filled her being, like a shadow or mist passing across her soul. It was strange and unfamiliar. She wasn't inwardly blaming her husband or lamenting her fate. She was just having a good cry. Mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her arms and nipping her feet.

The stinging mosquitoes dispelled a mood that might have held her there longer.

The next morning, Mr. Pontellier was up early to catch the steamer to the city. He was returning to his business and wouldn't be back until Saturday. He had regained his composure. He was eager to leave, looking forward to a lively week.

Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half the money from Klein's hotel. She liked money and accepted it with satisfaction.

“It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!” she said, counting the bills.

“Treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,” he laughed, kissing her goodbye.

The boys clung to his legs, asking for things to be brought back. Mr. Pontellier was a favorite, and everyone was on hand to say goodbye. His wife stood smiling and waving as he disappeared down the road.

A few days later, a box arrived from New Orleans. It was filled with treats, fruits, and bonbons.

Mrs. Pontellier was generous with the contents. The treats were brought to the dining room, and the bonbons were passed around. The ladies declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best husband. Mrs. Pontellier admitted she knew of none better.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around Mrs. Pontellier's internal struggle with her role as a wife and mother, and her desire for independence and self-discovery. This is illustrated through her interactions and the subtle discontent she experiences in her marriage to Mr. Pontellier.

Mrs. Pontellier seems to be grappling with societal expectations of her as a woman, particularly in the context of her marriage and motherhood. Her husband's dismissive attitude and the routine nature of their relationship contribute to her feelings of entrapment and dissatisfaction. This is evident when Mr. Pontellier reproaches her for neglecting their children and when he views her as a possession, noting her sunburn as though it were damage to property.

Moreover, Mrs. Pontellier's emotional turmoil is highlighted in her late-night crying episode, where she experiences an ""indescribable oppression"" and a sense of being weighed down by her life circumstances. This emotional outburst suggests a deeper longing for identity and fulfillment beyond her prescribed roles. Her interactions with Robert Lebrun further emphasize this conflict, as she finds herself drawn to his companionship, which offers an escape from her monotonous life.

Overall, the story explores themes of self-identity, autonomy, and the constraints of traditional gender roles, as Mrs. Pontellier begins to question her place in the world and seeks a sense of freedom and individuality.",What if the only time you felt truly alive was when you were with someone who wasn't your husband?,"Would you dare to discover who you really are, even if it meant defying everyone you know?",Imagine feeling trapped in a world where everyone sees you as just a wife and mother.

089.txt,"I couldn't help listening to the talk at the next table because the orchestra was quiet and the conversation was loud. Plus, I heard some nautical terms that caught my interest. I've always been interested in things related to ships and the sea. A quick glance showed me the speaker, a white-haired, sunburned old man in a spotless evening suit. With him at the restaurant table were other men dressed the same way, who seemed to be from good backgrounds. They called the white-haired man ""Commodore,"" which made me think he was a retired navy captain. His story confirmed it.

""Yes, sir,"" he said, lightly thumping the table. ""A good, sturdy merchant ship with nothing wrong except some neglect, like light sails being blown away and ropes not tied properly. There were no signs of fire, leaks, or fights to chase the crew away. There was plenty of food and water onboard. Yet, there she was, sailing along the sea of Biscay, completely deserted, with the deck almost covered with dead rats.""

""What killed them, Commodore?"" someone asked. ""And what happened to the crew?""

""Nobody knows,"" the Commodore replied. ""It might have been poisonous gas from the cargo, but if so, it didn't affect us after we boarded. The ship's log was missing, so we didn't get any information from that. Also, every lifeboat was in its place, as if some mysterious force had wiped out the crew and killed the rats. She was a grain ship from San Francisco, and grain ships are full of rats.""

""I was the officer who took her into Queenstown. She was condemned at an Admiralty hearing and later returned to her owners. But to this day, no one has explained that voyage. It's been over thirty years, but it remains one of the unexplained mysteries of the sea.""

The group left the table soon after, leaving me, an ex-sailor, deep in thought—not just because of the Commodore's story but because it stirred something in me, something hard to define. It was like recognizing something you’ve never seen before. It wasn’t about me or my adventures; I'd never heard of a deserted ship with all boats in place. It was something I must have heard somewhere else, unrelated to the sea and its mysteries. It bothered me so much that I couldn’t sleep that night, but I finally fell asleep and woke up remembering something from twenty-five years ago.

It's a long journey from that fancy restaurant to the dry plains of Arizona and back through years of work and struggle to a time when I was a sailor traveling across the country. But in my sleep, I made that journey, and the next morning, as I lay smoking my first pipe, I remembered my encounter with a half-witted tramp who had changed in front of me.

I was working for a cattle company, riding along the boundary each day to separate the company's cattle from a rival's. Near the end of the day, as I was returning to camp, I saw him coming along the road. His walk was distinct, something you never forget in a deep-water sailor. So, I greeted him in the manner of seamen.

""Well, mate, how are you heading?"" I asked, leaning over my saddle.

""Say, partner,"" he replied in a soft, whining voice, ""can you tell me where a feller might get a bite to eat around here?""

""Well,"" I said, ""yes and no. I thought you were a sailor."" Only his seamanly walk had appealed to me. His face, though bearded, tanned, and lined, seemed weak and crafty. He was tall and strong—the kind of man used to sudden effort—but he cringed under my stare even as I added, ""Yes, I’ll feed you."" I noticed a blue anchor tattooed on his wrist.

""Come along, old man,"" I said kindly. ""You're traveling for your health. I'll ask no questions and say nothing about you. My camp is just around that hill.""

He walked beside my horse, and we soon reached the camp, a log house with a fireplace, a rough table, and a couple of boxes for seats. It even had a plank floor, rare and luxurious in that country at the time. Under this floor lived a family of huge rats I couldn’t get rid of. I found it easier to feed them than have them gnaw into my stores when I was away. So they became quite tame, visiting me in the evenings but keeping a safe distance. I didn’t fear them; I rather enjoyed their company.

I took care of my horse and cooked our supper, which my guest ate eagerly. After supper, I filled my pipe and offered him another, but he refused. He didn’t smoke. As we talked, I found him to be slow-minded. He knew nothing of the sea or sailors and had forgotten when he got the anchor tattoo. He thought it had always been there. He was a laborer, a pick-and-shovel man, and that was all he aspired to. Disappointed, for I had hoped for a bit of seamanly company, I finished my smoke by the firelight and turned to get the bed ready when one of the rats shot from the bed across the floor and between my guest and the fire, disappearing into a hole. But its sudden appearance had a strange effect on the tramp. He choked, spluttered, stood up, and fell headlong to the floor.

""Hello!"" I said anxiously. ""Anything wrong?""

He got to his feet, looked wildly around, and asked in a hoarse, broken voice, ""What's this? Was I picked up? What ship is this?""

""No ship at all. It's a cow camp.""

""Log cabin, isn't it?""—he was staring at the walls. ""I never saw one before. I must have been out of my head for a while. Picked up, of course. Was the mate picked up? He was in bad shape.""

""Look here,"" I said gently. ""Are you out of your head now, or were you out of your head before?""

""I don't know. I must have been out of my head. I can't remember much after falling overboard until just now. What day is this?""

""Tuesday,"" I answered.

""Tuesday? It was Sunday when it happened. Did you have a hand in picking me up? Who was it?""

""Not me,"" I said. ""I found you on the road out here, dazed, knowing nothing of ships or sailors, though I took you for a shellback by your walk.""

""That's right. You can always spot one. You're a sailor, I can see, and an American, too. But what are you doing here? This must be the coast of Portugal or Spain.""

""No, this is a cow camp on the Crossbar Range in the middle of Arizona.""

""Arizona? Six thousand miles from there! How long have I been out of my head?""

""Don't know. I've only known you since sundown. You've just gone through a remarkable change.""

""What day of the month is it?""

""The third day of December.""

""Hell! Six months ago. It happened in June. Of course, six months is time enough for me to get here, but why can't I remember coming? Someone must have brought me.""

""Not necessarily. You were walking along, caring for yourself, but hungry. I brought you here for a feed and a night's sleep.""

""That was kind of you—"" He raised his hand to his face. ""I've grown a beard, I see. Let's see how I look with a beard."" He stepped to a mirror on the wall, took a look, and sprang back.

""Why, it isn't me!"" he exclaimed, looking around with wide eyes. ""It's someone else.""

""Take another look,"" I said. He did, moved his head right and left, and then turned to me.

""It must be me,"" he said hoarsely, ""for the image in the glass follows my movements. But I've lost my face. I'm another man. I don't know myself.""

""Look at that anchor on your wrist,"" I suggested. He did.

""Yes,"" he said, ""that part of me is left. It was inked on my first voyage."" He examined his arms and legs. ""Changed,"" he muttered, rubbing his knees and passing his hands over his body.

""What year was it when, as you say, you jumped overboard?"" I asked.

""Eighteen seventy-five.""

""This is eighteen eighty-four. Matey, you've been nine years out of your head,"" I said.

""Nine years? Sure? Can you prove that to me? My God, man, think of it! Nine years gone out of my life. You don't know what that means to me.""

I showed him a faded newspaper.

""That paper is about six months old,"" I said, ""but it's an eighteen eighty-four paper.""

""Right,"" he said sadly and wildly. ""Got a pipe? I want to smoke on this and think it out. Nine years and six thousand miles travel! Where have I been, I wonder, and what have I done to change the very face of me while I lived with it? It's something like death, I take it.""

I gave him a pipe and tobacco. He smoked, trembling with emotion, yet slowly pulling himself together. Finally, he steadied, but he couldn’t smoke. He put the pipe down, saying it sickened him. I knew nothing of psychology then, but now I think in his second personality, he had given up smoking.

I didn’t question him, knowing he had to work it out himself. He didn’t sleep that night, keeping me awake with his twitching and turning. Once he was up, looking at his face in the mirror by match light, but in the morning, after dozing for an hour or so, I found him outside, watching the sunrise and smoking.

""I'm getting used to my new face,"" he said, ""and getting used to smoking again. Got to. Nothing but a smoke will help a fellow sometimes. What business is this you're in?""

""Cow-punching—riding out after cattle.""

""Hard to learn?""

""Easy for a sailor. I'm hanging on until payday, then I make for San Francisco to ship.""

""And someone will take your place, I suppose. I'll work for my grub if you'll break me in so I can get the job. I'm through with going to sea.""

""Certainly. I'll tell the boss. I've an extra saddle.""

So I taught him cow-punching, and he learned quickly. But he seemed heavy and depressed, as if burdened by some terrible memory he was trying to shake off. It was not until the evening before I left, when I had secured him the job and we sat smoking, that he confided in me. The friendly rat appeared again, and he sprang up, backed away, and sat down, trembling.

""It was that rat that brought you to yourself that evening,"" I ventured. ""Rats must have had something to do with your past.""

""Right, they did,"" he replied, puffing fiercely. ""I didn't know you had rats here.""

""A whole lot of them under the floor. But they're harmless. I found them good company.""

""I found them bad company. I was shipmates with thousands of rats on that last passage. Want the yarn? It'll raise your hair.""

I was willing, and he told it. His strong self-control never left him from beginning to end, though it affected me deeply. I never saw him again, but I believe he never went to sea or told that yarn in shipping circles. And because I haven't seen the Commodore since the restaurant, and can't recall the ship's name or find data of marine happenings in 1875, I’m sharing this story, hoping it will explain to those interested the mystery of the grain ship, found in good shape, but abandoned by all but the dead rats.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in this story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of the crew from a seemingly well-maintained grain ship and the subsequent psychological turmoil of a sailor who might have been connected to that event. The story is framed by the narrator's encounter with a man who appears to have suffered a dissociative fugue, losing nine years of his life and his identity, only to be triggered back into awareness by the sight of a rat.

On a thematic level, the story explores the psychological conflict experienced by the sailor, who grapples with the loss of his past and identity. This internal struggle is compounded by the unresolved mystery of the deserted ship, which symbolizes the unknown and the subconscious fears that haunt him.

The sailor's transformation and the mystery of the ship raise questions about memory, identity, and the human mind's capacity to protect itself from trauma.

090.txt,"Reaching the ultimate secret was no problem ... but could I follow it up with an encore?

I really didn't want them to laugh at me about this. Not like when they laughed about the swimming.

""Oh, come on. No one can learn to swim by reading a book. Five-eighths of a mile the first time in the water!""

And they laughed. I guess I laughed, too. More than anything else, I wanted people to be happy. But I never swam again—just that first time.

I've always read a lot, and sometimes the things I've read get mixed up with what I've actually done. But those things still happened—they happened to _someone_. And people should _believe_.

I'd like to tell people now. I'd like to say, ""I died once.""

But if they laughed, it might be later, and I'd never hear them. There are already too many silent things in this. There mustn't be silent laughter, too.

They might think I've confused myself with things I've read. Things like surgeons bringing people back to life after they've died on the operating table. Doctors reviving dead soldiers if they haven't been gone too long.

It's not like that at all. I was truly dead—for three days. It was almost too long; I guess I barely made it back in time. I don't know.

My reading is what started this, just like with the swimming. When I think about it too much, I almost feel like I'm exaggerating a bit.

But I have proof, proof which no one has seen but the doctors and those who found me. See how they keep me wrapped in these cloths and how the darkened room hides my eyes?

Anyway, I'd be ashamed to show myself, because the mark of death is too terrible, and people would be more afraid of dying than they are now.

You see, I could have done it in winter, only I was worried about the cold. I might not have been able to get back at all. But it was too warm when I chose to do it. I should have known better. I've read a lot about preserving things. You can't keep them in hot weather; that's why doctors put those dead soldiers in ice chests, but I didn't think enough about it. I made some mistakes, too, but I couldn't have known.

I guess what started it all was something I read a long time ago, maybe in a story, or an agricultural bulletin, or maybe in an encyclopedia. Anyway, it was something about pigs being able to just die if they want to.

That always stuck in my mind. It's a pretty amazing thing, you know. Imagine just being able to die if life didn't seem worth living, or if you were lonely, or maybe just because you wanted to.

Oh, I told lots of people about it. You know how sometimes there's a lull in a conversation. Then I'd say, ""Pigs can just up and die if they want to.""

But nobody ever paid any attention to me at all. They seemed to ignore the remark. One man did say once, ""What are you talking about?"" but even he wouldn't listen when I tried to explain.

Maybe it was just too improbable. Besides, people don't like to think about death. They talk about it sometimes and sometimes they brood about it, but they never really think. It's always been too unknown, and that frightens them. Then they only fear and stop thinking.

It always seemed sad to me that no one had ever tried to help people out about death. Yes, I know one did. He died and came back—but then He wasn't just a man like you or me. And even He never said exactly what it was like.

I wondered if anyone really ever _had_ said. So I began to read with only one purpose in mind. I had to know so I could tell people. If they could only know, then they wouldn't have that fear, and we could talk of death and still be able to laugh.

But I had read it all when I read of Jacob's dream, because that was all there was—dreams, visions, hopes. No one had ever seen and come back to tell the others.

The question then was _why_, not _what_. It couldn't be that all who died had no whole being to return to. Not every death is marked by a body completely uninhabitable. I myself had heard a doctor say, ""There is nothing organically wrong now. The patient will recover if only he has the will to live.""

_The will to live!_ Suddenly I knew I had found the way. I myself would go and see and return to tell them all.

I answered all the requirements. I had a healthy body to return to. I had the will to live, because I enjoy my reading and acquaintances. And I alone had thought it wonderful that pigs can die when they merely want to.

I knew that I could, too, and I wasn't afraid. Very carefully, I began what seemed almost too simple preparations.

Drawing some money from an account I kept for medical expenses (at the time I thought this was very amusing), I bought an electric clock which registered the hour and the day of the month on cylinders like those on a tachometer. I felt I would want to know exactly how long I had been deceased when I came back.

Next, I got a small round mirror with a concave face, the type some people use for shaving. This I was to hang directly above my face. It was just vanity on my part, because I wanted to say that I, like Lazarus's friends, had seen a dead man rise. I assumed that at first my vision might be blurred, and so the magnifying effect of this particular glass would, I thought, help me focus on my face.

On my study floor, I prepared a pallet. It was neither soft nor hard, just a comfortable support for the body I was to leave. Beside it, I arranged a basin of water and some soft cloths, because I would want to wash right after coming back.

You see, I didn't fear the obvious. My power lay in thought, and I proceeded systematically.

Drawn blinds and two small night-lights spread a gray cast over the room, a cast that I was to know too well.

Everything was ready now. No, wait! Quickly I placed a tumbler and a decanter of brandy within easy reach and by them laid a pencil and a pad of paper. It was when I straightened up that I first felt the pounding in my body. My heart pulsed as if it were smashing waves of blood through my veins. In my throat, the large arteries swelled with pressure until I thought I would choke.

I had to have some physical exertion to relieve the tension. I felt I might faint or have a stroke unless I moved about. My father had been stricken with an embolism at about my age, and I've read such weaknesses are inherited.

So I walked around the house rechecking the locks of windows and doors. Maybe it was just to keep busy for a few more moments that I even rechecked the pads of cardboard with which I had muffled the bell-clappers on both telephone and door chime. I don't seem to have had many callers for several years now, but I had to avoid any chance of being disturbed.

Somewhat calmed by my exertion, I prepared to lie down, but a sentimental whim moved me like a robot toward the window. It was the only really unreasonable thing I did.

Like a prisoner denied the light on penalty of torture, I knelt down and looked under the blind. Never was the Sun so dazzling. This slight lifting of the shade poured onto me a warmth that I had never known before.

An old saying, invading my mind, destroyed the illusion, and laughing a bit nervously at ""seeking his place in the Sun,"" I turned away and lay down.

The dials on my new calendar clock showed 3:15, July 12. Reaching for my pad and pencil, I recorded this and then, refolding my hands across my chest, I lay quite still.

The heat of the day had begun to saturate the closed room. Outside, all was quiet, as if the Sun had mesmerized the world. The insect hum of the electric clock was the only clue of life around me.

Looming large above me in the mirror, the magnified reflection of my face calmed my mind with its calmness. Great-lidded Buddha eyes gazed down, holding in their glow my first understanding of Nirvana.

I knew that it had come. I had reached the boundary where the fear of returnless going stopped the mind just this side.

My only body consciousness was the heavy _thud_ ... _thud_ ... _thud_ of blood being pumped through my veins. I toyed with stopping the thudding, feeling and savoring the pause between those sledge-hammer strokes on my brain—knowing that any one of those pauses lengthened to eternity was death.

Suddenly I shrieked and sat upright. For an instant, my body had completely stopped and I had known it. Only a nameless grasping fear had snatched me back.

My heart beat wildly as I gasped for air. With shaking hands, I poured a drink and gulped it down. It had been close.

Still trembling, I got up and slumped into a chair. I had to organize myself, to think my way along this thing.

What had happened to me?

This one thing I knew: I _could_ do it. I could stop my body at will, and I had done it, if only for a second.

This thought reassured me or maybe the brandy opened my reserve of courage, because I had been sitting in the chair for some time.

With caution, I approached the pallet. I regarded it with suspicion, as though there were a deadly scorpion in its folds. Then, jeering at my hesitation, I lay down and composed myself as before. The clock said 5:05. I stirred again only to record this on the pad.

Despite my nervousness, things proceeded faster this time. A morbid excitement carried me along the path I now already knew. And at its end, I flirted with the _stopping_. Going over and stepping back, going over and stepping back.

It was a pleasure exquisite and unique. Once felt, it was irresistible.

I was no longer afraid. I didn't have to be. I could stop my body and start it at will. So I let it slip away from me. The thuddings ceased and only the pauses remained—silent, shapeless things in endless procession. And then the great silence. It flowed over me and I was lost.

The silence was too heavy and my thoughts were not my own; they floated up away from me in the silence. I could feel them go, but there was nothing to bring them back. Each thought of protest winged its way into a void with all the rest.

And nothing else remained but the will to live. As the silence lapped around this will, it grew until it alone was I. The silence washed about it, but it stood.

Then the little rippings and the slicings and the tearings and the softening of things were there—heard without sound, felt without feeling, like the pulling of a tooth from a numbed jaw.

It was then I saw the face.

Have you ever felt the terror of suddenly waking with a face—a face of eyes—staring into your unguarded and bewildered first glance? One feels as if this face would look into one's very life and wrest it from him. Perhaps it is a nascent fear of one's own mask of death.

But I couldn't escape the mask. It loomed above me with gaping maw and staring eyes; eyes that seemed more dead and deadly as my vision cleared. The mirror enlarged the horror that lay below it.

It was the wrench of nausea that pulled me from this nightmare. In the violence of the retching, I rolled from beneath the mirror and raised myself to hands and knees. I had knocked over the clock and it shouted up at me—10:05, July 15. Three days! Too long! Too horribly long!

Slowly I dragged myself to the telephone and pulled it from the stand. I remember nothing else until they brought me here.

It's been eight days—eight days away from death, yet I'm closer to it now than ever before. And I can't _think_ of it. The fear has come crashing through and I can't _think_.

This thing, this body is too far gone. I won't be able to make it move. I'll just feel it getting away—little by little—ripping apart cell by cell, and then everywhere all at once.

I can feel it now. But in that great silence, I could almost hear the tearing—yet there was no sound.

The doctors have given up all hope. I can see it in their faces. I could hear them talking among themselves when they brought me in. They had to give it a name. There's a certain safety in a name, you know.

I would have told them, but I was afraid they'd laugh. The nurses would laugh and say to each other, ""Have you heard what the one in 408 wanted in his case history?""

I couldn't stand the laughter now.

But that's the way my chart should read—Cause of Death:—_Death!_

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Cause of Death, by Max Tadlock",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""Cause of Death"" revolves around the protagonist's existential struggle and the dilemma of proving his extraordinary experience with death without inviting ridicule. The protagonist, driven by an insatiable curiosity about death and the unknown, attempts a dangerous experiment to die intentionally and return to life with insights to share with others. This endeavor is motivated by his belief that understanding death could eliminate the fear and trepidation people have towards it.

However, the protagonist's conflict is twofold. Firstly, there is the internal conflict of overcoming the fear and physical challenge of stopping and restarting his own heart—a feat he believes he can accomplish. Secondly, there is the external conflict of societal disbelief and ridicule. He fears that, like his previous attempt to prove he could learn to swim from a book, his story of dying and returning would be met with skepticism and laughter. This fear of being mocked or misunderstood prevents him from sharing his experience and the knowledge he believes he has gained.

Ultimately, the protagonist's experiment results in unintended consequences, leaving him physically deteriorated and closer to death than before. He grapples with the realization that he may not be able to recover, and his efforts to demystify death may go uncommunicated and unrecognized, reinforcing his fear of ridicule and rejection. The story explores themes of the human quest for knowledge, the fear of the unknown, and the societal pressures that silence unconventional experiences.",Imagine you could die and come back to life—would you risk it just to tell others what it's like?,What if proving your greatest discovery meant risking your life and facing everyone's laughter?,"Can you imagine dying on purpose just to prove a point, knowing people might just laugh it off?",science fiction,tragedy,good vs. evil,What did the narrator try to do?,"The narrator tried to stop their body and then restart it, essentially attempting to die and come back to life.",Why did the narrator want to die and come back?,"The narrator wanted to understand death and be able to tell others about it, hoping to remove the fear of death by sharing their experience.",What did the narrator use to track the time they were dead?,"The narrator used an electric clock that registered the hour and the day of the month on cylinders, like those on a tachometer.",How does the narrator's reading habits influence their actions?,"The narrator's extensive reading led them to believe in the possibility of dying and returning, as they were inspired by stories of resurrection and the idea that pigs can die at will.

092.txt,"The day had barely begun. Over Mount Vesuvius, a wide gray band of mist stretched out to Naples, casting shadows over the small towns along the coast. The sea was calm. Along the shore beneath the Sorrento cliffs, fishermen and their wives were already busy. Some were pulling in their boats with the nets they had set the night before, while others were preparing their boats, adjusting the sails, or retrieving oars and masts from deep vaults built into the rocks for overnight storage. Everyone was working; even the elderly, who had stopped going to sea, helped haul in the nets. On some flat rooftops, old women spun yarn or took care of their grandchildren, who had been left by their mothers to help their fathers.

""Look, Rachela, there's our priest,"" said one woman to a little girl of ten, who was spinning beside her. ""Antonio is going to row him to Capri. Poor Padre, he looks so sleepy!"" She waved to a kind-looking little priest who was settling into a boat, spreading his robe to sit comfortably.

The men on the quay paused to watch their pastor leave, and he nodded and waved back.

""Why is he going to Capri, Granny?"" the child asked. ""Don't they have their own priest there?""

""Silly girl!"" the granny scolded. ""They have plenty of priests—and a beautiful church, plus a hermit, which is more than we have. But a great lady who once lived here is very sick there. Our Padre had to visit her many times, bringing her the Holy Sacrament when they thought she wouldn't survive the night. Thanks to the Blessed Virgin, she got better and even swam in the sea. When she left, she gave a big donation to our church and the poor. She insisted our Padre visit her in Capri so she could confess to him as before. She really trusts him, and we're blessed to have a priest with talents enough to be an archbishop, so respected by important people. God be with him!"" she cried, waving again as the boat left the shore.

""Will we have good weather, my son?"" asked the little priest, looking anxiously toward Naples.

""The sun isn’t up yet,"" the young man replied. ""When it rises, it will clear away that mist easily.""

""Let's go then! We should get there before it gets too hot.""

Antonio was about to push the boat away when he suddenly stopped, staring at the top of the steep path leading down from Sorrento. A tall, slender girl appeared, quickly descending the path and waving a handkerchief. She carried a small bundle and wore a simple dress, but held her head high with a regal air, her dark hair like a crown.

""Why are we waiting?"" asked the priest.

""Someone wants to go to Capri, if you allow, Padre. The boat won't be slower for it. She's just a young girl, about eighteen.""

Just then, the girl emerged from behind the wall lining the path.

""Laurella!"" exclaimed the priest. ""What brings her to Capri?""

Antonio shrugged. She approached rapidly, eyes focused ahead.

""Ha! L'Arrabiata! Good morning!"" some young men called out. If the priest hadn’t been there, they might have said more, but the defiant look she gave them held them back.

""Good day, Laurella!"" said the priest. ""How are you? Are you traveling with us to Capri?""

""If I may, Padre.""

""Ask Antonio; the boat is his. A man is master of his own, as God is master of us all.""

""Here’s half a carlino, if I may join you?"" said Laurella, not looking at Antonio.

""You need it more than I,"" he muttered, moving some orange baskets to make room. He was taking oranges to Capri, where they couldn’t grow enough for all the visitors.

""I don’t want to travel for free,"" she frowned slightly.

""Come now,"" said the priest, ""he’s a good lad and doesn’t want to take that little bit of your money. Come, sit by me. He’s spread his jacket for you to sit on. Young people are always ready to do more for a young girl than for ten of us old men. Don’t refuse, Tonino. It’s natural for like to be drawn to like.""

Laurella stepped in, seating herself beside the priest, putting aside Antonio's jacket without a word. Antonio left it there, muttering under his breath, and gave a push to the pier. The boat glided into the open bay.

""What’s in your bundle?"" asked the priest, as they floated over the calm sea, the first rays of the sun just touching the water.

""Silk, thread, and a loaf, Padre. The silk is for a ribbon-maker in Anacapri, and the thread for another woman.""

""Did you spin it yourself?""

""Yes, sir.""

""You once learned to weave ribbons, didn’t you?""

""I did, sir. But my mother’s been worse, and I can’t stay away from home long enough. We can’t afford a loom.""

""Worse? Last Easter, when I visited, she was up and about.""

""Spring is always hard on her. Since the big storms and earthquakes, she’s been bedridden with pain.""

""Pray, my child. Never cease your prayers to the Blessed Virgin for help. Work hard and be good, so your prayers will be heard.""

After a pause: ""When you were coming down, I heard them calling you 'L'Arrabiata.' Why do they call you that? It’s not a nice name for a young Christian girl, who should be gentle.""

Laurella's face flushed, her eyes fierce.

""They mock me because I don’t sing and dance and chatter like other girls. I do them no harm and wish they’d leave me alone.""

""But you could be kinder. Let others dance and sing; kind words are fitting even for those burdened by life.""

Her eyes lowered, her brows furrowing as if to hide them.

They traveled in silence. The sun rose bright over the mountains; only Vesuvius’s tip stood above the clouds. Houses on the Sorrento plains gleamed white amidst dark green orange groves.

""Have you heard from that painter, Laurella?"" asked the priest, ""the Neapolitan who wanted to marry you?"" She shook her head. ""He wanted to paint you. Why didn’t you let him?""

""What for? There are prettier girls. Who knows what he’d do with it? My mother says he might have bewitched me or done harm.""

""Don’t believe such things,"" said the priest earnestly. ""Aren’t you always in God’s care, and can one poor mortal’s image defy the Lord? Besides, he cared for you; why else propose?""

She was silent.

""Why did you refuse him? He was honest and handsome, and could have supported you and your mother better than your spinning.""

""We’re so poor,"" she said fiercely, ""and Mother’s been ill so long. We’d be a burden. I’d never fit as a signora. When his friends visited, he’d be ashamed.""

""How can you say that? He was good and kind, willing to settle in Sorrento. It’s rare to find one like him, sent to save you.""

""I want no husband—ever,"" she said stubbornly to herself.

""Is it a vow? Do you plan to be a nun?""

She shook her head.

""People are right to call you stubborn, though the name they give you isn’t kind. Have you thought you’re alone, and your stubbornness worsens your mother’s illness? What reason do you have to refuse an honest hand? Tell me, Laurella.""

""I have a reason,"" she said reluctantly, quietly, ""but I can’t share it.""

""Not share it? Not with me, your friend and confessor?""

Laurella nodded.

""Then, child, unburden your heart. If your reason is good, I’ll support you. You’re young and know little of the world. You might regret missing happiness for a foolish notion.""

Shyly, she glanced at the boat’s end, where the young man rowed, his cap low, gazing away, lost in thought.

The priest noticed and leaned in.

""You didn’t know my father?"" she whispered, dark anger in her eyes.

""Your father, child! He died when you were ten. What does he have to do with this?""

""You didn’t know. Mother’s illness is his fault alone.""

""How?""

""He mistreated her; he beat her. I remember nights he came home in rages. She never complained, did everything he asked, yet he’d beat her, breaking my heart. I’d pretend to sleep, but I cried all night. Seeing her on the floor, he’d suddenly change, lift her, kiss her, till she screamed he smothered her. Mother forbade me to speak of it, but it wore her out. She’s never recovered since he died. If she dies soon—God forbid—I know who killed her.""

The priest shook his head, unsure how to respond. Finally, he said, ""Forgive him, as your mother did! Turn from such memories, Laurella; better days may come to make you forget.""

""Never shall I forget!"" she shuddered. ""It’s why I won’t marry. I’ll never be under a man who might beat or kiss me. I’d defend myself now, but Mother couldn’t—from blows or kisses—because she loved him. I’ll never love a man enough to be hurt by him.""

""You’re young and don’t know life. Are all men like your father? Do all mistreat their wives, yielding to whims and passions? Haven’t you seen good men, good wives living in peace?""

""Nobody knew how Father was. Mother wouldn’t complain or tell, because she loved him. If that’s love—if it silences cries for help, makes us suffer more than our worst enemy—I’ll never love a man.""

""You’re childish; you know not what you say. When love comes, you may not choose it."" After a pause, he asked, ""Did you think the painter cruel?""

""He had those eyes—I’ve seen Father make—begging pardon, taking Mother in his arms to make up. I know those eyes. A man can make them, yet beat a wife who never vexed him! It chilled me to see them again.""

She wouldn’t speak further. The priest remained silent, pondering wise words to admonish her, but refrained, seeing the young boatman restless at her confession.

After two hours, they reached Capri’s bay. Antonio carried the padre through the shallow water to dry land. But Laurella didn’t wait for him, splashing through, holding her petticoat, shoes, and bundle.

""I’ll stay in Capri,"" said the priest. ""No need to wait—I may not return before tomorrow. Remember me to your mother; I’ll visit within the week. You’ll go back before dark?""

""If I find a way,"" she replied, focused on her skirts.

""I must return,"" said Antonio indifferently. ""I’ll wait until the Ave Maria. If you don’t come, no matter.""

""You must,"" said the priest. ""You can’t leave your mother alone at night. Is it far?""

""To a vineyard by Anacapri.""

""And I to Capri. God bless you, child—and you, my son.""

Laurella kissed his hand, bidding farewell to both. Antonio only acknowledged the priest, ignoring Laurella. But after they turned away, he watched the padre briefly, then followed Laurella with his gaze as she climbed, hand shading her eyes from the sun. Before the path vanished behind walls, she paused and looked back, as if the scene was worth a moment’s pause. Her glance met Antonio’s, who had been watching her.

Each made a slight gesture, as if excusing a mistake, and with a dark look, she continued.

Antonio waited on a tavern bench, restless, as if expecting something. He claimed to distrust the weather, noting the sea and sky looked like before the last storm. He asked the hostess to think of him if it changed.

""Many visitors over there?"" she asked.

""It’s just starting. The season has been bad; late bathers.""

""The spring was late. Did you earn more than us in Capri?""

""Not enough for macaroni twice a week, if only the boat. Just letters to Naples or fishing trips. But I have a rich uncle with fine orange groves. ‘Tonino,’ he says, ‘while I live, you’ll want for nothing; when I’m gone, I’ve taken care of you.’ With God’s help, I got through the winter.""

""Has he children, this rich uncle?""

""No, he never married; he traveled and saved well. He plans a fishing business, with me in charge.""

""You’re a made man, Tonino!""

He shrugged. ""Every man has his burden,"" he said, checking the weather again, though knowing no weather side but one.

""Another bottle?"" she offered. ""Your uncle can pay.""

""Just a glass; your wine is fiery, my head is hot.""

""It doesn’t heat the blood; drink as you like. Here’s my husband; talk with him.""

The osteria’s padrone arrived, waving a welcome, sitting beside Antonio, chattering. As his wife brought more wine, they heard footsteps; Laurella approached from Anacapri, nodding slightly. She hesitated.

Antonio stood. ""I must go,"" he said. ""A Sorrento girl came with the padre. She needs to return to her sick mother.""

""Plenty of time before night,"" said the fisherman. ""Time for a glass. Wife, another!""

""Thank you; I’d rather not,"" Laurella kept her distance.

""Fill the glasses; she needs pressing.""

""Don’t,"" Antonio interposed. ""She has a stubborn head; a saint couldn’t persuade her."" He took leave, loosening the boat, waiting for Laurella. She nodded to the hostess, slowly approaching the water, looking around for others. The marina was deserted; fishermen were asleep or rowing, women and children spun or slept. Strangers waited to return in the evening. Before she could prevent him, Antonio carried her to the boat like a child. He leapt in, rowing into deep water.

She sat at the boat’s end, turning away, showing only her profile. She wore a stern look; her brow shaded by hair, lips firm, nostrils quivering. After a while, she felt the sun's heat, unbundled her handkerchief, and began eating bread, having eaten nothing in Capri.

Antonio didn’t stand it long; he offered her oranges from the baskets. ""Here, eat with your bread, Laurella. Don’t think I kept them for you; they rolled out, I found them bringing back the baskets.""

""Eat them yourself; bread is enough for me.""

""They’re refreshing in this heat, after your long walk.""

""I drank water; that refreshed me.""

""As you please,"" he said, dropping them back.

Silence. The sea was glassy, no ripples against the bow. Even the white sea-birds hunted soundlessly.

""You might take the oranges to your mother,"" Antonio suggested.

""We have oranges; when they’re gone, I can buy more.""

""Take them to her, give them with my compliments.""

""She doesn’t know you.""

""You could tell her who I am.""

""I don’t know you either.""

It wasn’t the first time she denied him. When that painter first came to Sorrento, Antonio had been playing boccia, and the painter saw Laurella with a pitcher, not noticing him standing in the game. A ball hit his shins, reminding him this wasn’t a place for thought. He looked for an excuse, but Antonio stood defiantly silent. The stranger left. Later, when the painter courted Laurella, he asked if she refused for Antonio’s sake. ""I don’t even know him,"" she said indignantly. But she’d heard the gossip and knew Antonio since.

Now they sat like enemies, hearts racing. Antonio’s face reddened; he rowed sharply, foam spraying Laurella, lips muttering angrily. She ignored him, seeming oblivious, cooling her hands in the water, smoothing her hair, brows twitching, cheeks burning.

Out in open sea, the island far behind, the coast distant in haze, no sail in sight, not even a gull. Antonio seemed resolved on something, his cheeks paled, he dropped the oars. Laurella turned, fearless, attentive.

""I must end this,"" he burst out. ""It’s lasted too long! I wonder it hasn’t killed me! You say you don’t know me? You must’ve seen me pass like a madman, heart full of what I had to tell you; you turned away.""

""What had I to say?"" she retorted. ""I saw you meddling, but I won’t be on wicked tongues for nothing. I won’t have you as a husband—nor anyone.""

""Nor anyone? You won’t always say so! You say it now, refusing that painter. Bah! You’ll feel lonely someday; wild as you are, you’ll take the next who comes.""

""Who knows? Who sees the future? I may change my mind. What’s that to you?""

""What’s it to me?"" he shouted, standing, the boat rocking. ""What’s it to me? You know! That man shall perish to whom you’re kinder than to me!""

""What did I promise? Am I to blame if you’re mad? What right have you?""

""I know,"" he cried, ""my right isn’t written or stamped. But I feel I have the right to you like I have to heaven if I die an honest Christian. Could I watch you marry another, see girls shrug at me?""

""You can do as you please. I won’t be frightened by threats. I’ll do as I please.""

""You won’t say so long!"" He shook with passion. ""I won’t let my life be spoiled by a stubborn girl! You’re in my power, remember, and may do my bidding.""

She started, eyes flashing. ""You may kill me if you dare,"" she said slowly.

""I do nothing by halves,"" he said hoarsely. ""There’s room for us both in the sea. I can’t help thee, child,"" he spoke dreamily, pitifully, ""but we both must go down together—both at once—now!"" He snatched her, but drew back; she had bitten him fiercely.

""Can I be made to do your bidding?"" she cried, thrusting him away, ""am I in your power?"" And she leapt into the sea.

She rose, skirts clinging, hair heavy, struck out, swimming silently toward shore.

Terrified, he watched, senses numbed, as if witnessing a miracle. Then, shaking himself, he seized the oars, rowing with all his strength, blood reddening the boat.

He reached her quickly. ""For the love of the Virgin,"" he cried, ""get in the boat! I’ve been mad! God knows what darkened my mind. It came like lightning, setting me on fire. I knew not what I did or said. I don’t ask forgiveness, Laurella, only come into the boat; don’t risk your life!""

She swam on, as if not hearing.

""You can’t swim to land! It’s two miles off. Think of your mother! If you’re harmed, I’d die of horror.""

She judged the distance, then swam to the boat, laying hands on the edge; he rose to help her. The boat tilted with her weight, his jacket slipped into the water. Agile, she swung aboard without help, regaining her seat. He took the oars, while she wrung her clothes, shook water from her hair. Seeing the blood, she glanced at his uninjured hand.

""Take this,"" she said, offering her handkerchief. He shook his head, rowing. After a time, she rose, bound her handkerchief around the deep wound, ignoring his protests, took an oar, seated opposite, rowing steadily, eyes fixed on the scarlet oar. Both silent and pale. As they neared land, fishermen jeered, but neither flinched or spoke.

The sun still high over Procida as they landed. Laurella shook her petticoat, jumped ashore. An old woman on her terrace called, ""What’s on your hand, Tonino? Jesus! The boat’s full of blood!""

""It’s nothing, comare,"" he replied. ""I tore my hand on a nail; it’ll heal tomorrow. It’s just my blood making it worse.""

""Let me bind it, comparello. I’ll fetch herbs.""

""Don’t trouble, comare. It’s dressed already; by morning it’ll be forgotten. I heal quickly.""

""Addio,"" said Laurella, climbing the cliff path. ""Goodnight,"" he replied, not looking at her, taking oars and baskets, ascending to his hut.

Alone in his two rooms, he paced. The breeze cooled him. He knelt before the Virgin image, gazing at the silver-paper star halo. But he didn’t pray. Why pray now, having lost all hope?

The day seemed endless; he longed for night, weary, blood loss affecting him. His hand throbbed painfully. Sitting on a stool, he untied the handkerchief; blood gushed, hand swollen.

He washed it, cooling the wound, saw Laurella’s teeth marks.

""She was right,"" he said; ""I was a brute, deserved no better. I’ll send her handkerchief back with Giuseppe. She’ll never see me again."" He carefully washed the handkerchief, drying it in the sun.

He bound his hand with teeth and left hand, lay on his bed, closing his eyes.

Moonlight and pain woke him; he rose for water, heard a sound at the door. Laurella stood there.

She entered without question, removed her headscarf, placed her basket on the table, took a deep breath.

""You came for your handkerchief,"" he said. ""No need for the trouble. I’d have sent it with Giuseppe.""

""It’s not the handkerchief,"" she said quickly. ""I’ve gathered herbs to stop the bleeding; see here."" She opened her basket.

""Too much trouble,"" he said, ""far too much. I’m better, much better; if worse, it’s what I deserve. Why come at night? If someone sees you? You know how they talk, even without knowing.""

""I care not for talk,"" she said passionately. ""I came for your hand, to apply the herbs; you can’t do it with your left.""

""It’s not necessary, I tell you.""

""Let me see it then, to believe you.""

She took his hand, unbinding the linen. Seeing the swelling, she shuddered. ""Jesus Maria!""

""It’s slightly swollen,"" he said; ""it’ll be gone in a day.""

She shook her head. ""A week before you can work.""

""More likely a day or two; if not, what matters?""

She fetched a basin, washed the wound, he passive as a child. She applied healing leaves, soothing the burn, bound it with linen she’d brought.

When done: ""I thank you,"" he said. ""Now, if you’d do me a kindness, forgive my madness; forget my words and deeds. I don’t know how it came; not your fault—not yours. Never will you hear from me a word to vex you.""

She interrupted. ""I should beg pardon. I should’ve spoken differently. I might’ve explained better, not enraged you. And the bite—""

""It was self-defense; high time to wake me. As I said, it’s nothing. Don’t talk of forgiveness; you only did good, and I thank you. Here’s your handkerchief; take it.""

He offered it, but she hesitated, struggling inwardly. At last she said: ""You lost your jacket, by my fault; all the orange money was in it. I didn’t think of it till later. I can’t replace it now; we haven’t so much—or it’s Mother’s. But this I have—a silver cross. The painter left it last time. I haven’t looked at it, don’t care to keep it; if you sell it? Mother says it’s worth a few piastres. It might cover your loss; if not, I’ll earn the rest spinning at night, when Mother sleeps.""

""Nothing will make me take it,"" he said, pushing the bright cross away.

""You must; how long might your hand keep you from work? There it lies; I’ll not look at it again.""

""Drop it in the sea, then.""

""It’s no gift, just what’s due; it’s only fair.""

""Nothing’s due from you; hereafter when we meet, if you’d do me a kindness, don’t look my way. It’d make me feel you remember what I’ve done. Now goodnight; let this be the last word.""

She placed the handkerchief and cross in the basket, closing the lid. But looking at her face, he started. Tears rolled down her cheeks; she let them flow unheeded.

""Maria Santissima!"" he cried. ""Are you ill? You’re trembling!""

""It’s nothing,"" she said; ""I must go home,"" taking unsteady steps to the door, suddenly leaning against the wall, sobbing. Before he reached her, she turned, falling on his neck.

""I can’t bear it!"" she cried, clinging to him. ""I can’t bear it! I can’t let you speak kindly, send me with this on my conscience. Beat me! Curse me! Or if you love me still, after all I’ve done, take me, keep me, do as you please; only don’t send me away!"" She sobbed.

Speechless, he held her. ""If I can love you still!"" he cried. ""Holy Mother! Do you think my heart’s blood gone from that wound? Don’t you hear it hammering, ready to burst my breast? But if you say this to try me, or out of pity, I can forget it. You owe me nothing.""

""No!"" she said resolutely, looking up from his shoulder, tearful eyes; ""I love you. I feared to love you, so cross. I’ll be different now. I can’t pass you without a look! And lest you doubt, I’ll kiss you, so you’ll say, 'She kissed me;' Laurella kisses no man but her husband.""

She kissed him thrice, escaping his arms. ""Now goodnight, amor mio, cara vita mia!"" she said. ""Sleep, let your hand heal. Don’t come with me; I fear no man, save you alone.""

She slipped out, disappearing in the shadow.

He stood by the window, gazing over the calm sea, stars flitting before his eyes.

Next time the little curato sat in his confessional, he smiled to himself. Laurella had just risen after a long confession.

""Who’d have thought,"" he mused, ""the Lord would soon pity that wayward heart? I reproached myself for not sternly exorcising that perverse demon. Our eyes are short-sighted to Heaven’s ways!

094.txt,"A long time ago, Lincoln said something important. It took a tiny plant on a distant world to prove it across the galaxy.

The following story was found when digging a tunnel near Issahar on the planet Kwashior. A worker found a bunch of old metal pieces, which was strange since Kwashior didn’t have any recorded history of metal artifacts. The engineer in charge, Assasul, realized this might be important and wanted to check it out carefully.

The metal pieces turned out to be parts of an old spaceship, much smaller and simpler than the ones we know about from history. Inside the ship was a metal box covered in layers of fabric. The metal was rusty, but inside the box were some old, fragile sheets covered with writing. These sheets were written in an ancient language with ink that has lasted a long time. Although much of it was hard to read, enough was clear to answer a big historical question and support a theory about people moving from Earth.

Experts have confirmed this find is real. It’s about 10,000 years old, from the start of a time called the Intellectual Emergence. This find is extremely important. It changes how we might think about where people originally came from. Here’s the translated text. You can decide what it means.

-BARRAGOND-
Monitor of Cultural Origins and Relics Kwashior Central Repository

I’ve decided to write this journal. It’s a bit selfish, really, since I don’t think anyone will read it if I don’t make it out of here. But it comforts me to think a part of me will remain after I’m gone. Many famous people from Earth, like Homer, Einstein, and Lincoln, live on through their work. I don’t expect to be as famous, but it’s nice to think a part of me might survive.

(Note: Some lines here are unreadable. Missing parts will look like this: ...)

... I think it’s natural for spacemen to like being around others. I’m not a real spaceman, but I’ve been to space, so I’m like my old crew in that way. I miss the company, the card games, and the talks about what’s next or what we’ll do when we get back to Earth.

... I remember Gregory. Funny, I never knew if that was his first or last name. He always talked about what he’d do with wine, women, and song when we returned to Earth. Poor Gregory. A meteor hit the ship right in the engine room where he was working. He probably never knew what happened. At least it was quick. Unlike my situation...

There was time for those who survived to get to the lifeboats. There were enough boats, which increased our chances of survival. I guess it was silly to think only of myself, but I’m not a trained spaceman. I’m a biologist, part of the scientific team. I knew how to seal myself in, hit the eject button, and start the engine. But I didn’t know the lifeboat had no way to stop the fast movement, so I ended up far out in space, lost. I couldn’t find any other lifeboats or contact them by radio. A part wasn’t working, and by the time I figured it out, I was too far. I had to choose a star, set the controls, and go into a deep sleep until I got there. If I stayed awake, I’d run out of oxygen before finding a planet I could live on.

I woke up orbiting this world. After checking things out, I decided to land. I didn’t do a great job, using the rockets too late and burning a lot of the meadow where I landed. The boat’s engines are messed up, so it won’t fly again without repairs I can’t do. But the boat is okay as a shelter, and I’m healing from a few bruises. Soon I’ll be ready to explore.

I’m surprised this planet can support human life. Scientists thought very few planets would be livable. Maybe I’m lucky. At least I’m alive, and the lifeboat is a good shelter. The survival kits are fine, so I can manage here. We’re learning a lot about the galaxy with our new space travel. Some expert opinions aren’t as solid as we thought.

This world is like Earth in almost every way, except there are no animals, no birds, no insects. It’s just plants. It’s very quiet, just the wind in the trees and grasses. I’m completely alone. It feels strange. There’s freedom in it, not having people around. But I already wish I had someone to talk to, to share ideas and plans.

My first thought about this place was wrong. The life here, though not animals, is at least smart—and it’s not friendly. It’s curious about me, and I can feel it. It’s a strange feeling, not scary but uncomfortable. I noticed it yesterday, a sudden unease like waking from a bad dream, and it’s getting stronger.

The main feelings I got from this presence were self-awareness and a sense of identity. It’s like it knows it exists. I wonder what Descartes would think of an alien quoting his philosophy. I think it’s more animal-like, even though there are no animals here. Its thoughts are quick and getting clearer. It knows I’m here. I’ll call it “it” until I know more. There’s no sense of gender. It’s odd, but I’ve even started swearing, which I don’t usually do. This place affects my nerves, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s unsettling, like being watched and examined. 

I’ve looked around and found nothing. You might laugh, but I can’t. I’m jumpy, reacting to every noise. I feel like I’m being watched. My skin crawls, and my mind is filled with dread. I’m really scared, but there’s nothing I can see. I know being scared all the time isn’t good for me. My body can’t stay ready to fight or run forever. My adrenaline can’t keep pumping, or it’ll wear me out. But I’m not dead yet, and I’m smart. I can adjust. Humans are good at adapting. I have tools and materials here. I’m desperate, but I should be able to do something.

But it’s not going well. I don’t know enough about electronics to fix things quickly. The pressure is getting stronger. It feels like it wants something from me. I think I’m going to be absorbed.

The fear is constant. I still look for my enemy. It’s become my enemy because it threatens my life. My waking hours are terrible, and my sleep is full of nightmares. People hold onto life and sanity. But this can’t last much longer. I have to act. I’ll try again to find and stop it before it stops me.

I’ll never want to be alone again. If I survive, I’ll always stay around people. I’d give anything to have just one person here with me. I think two of us could handle this. I’m getting strange sensations, like floating in water. It’s weird.

That last attack was intense! I messed up a whole week’s work looking for something that wasn’t there. The urge to destroy the source of my misery is growing. I’m still sane, but I can’t take much more. I’m working on a beacon to signal for help. I hope it works. I dread taking apart the recorder, but I might have to. Music helps me cope, though it’s getting repetitive. I keep wondering how long I can last.

More nightmares last night. I got an idea from them. Water is essential for life, so maybe my enemy isn’t on land. It could be in the water. I’ll find out today. Just doing something makes me feel better.

I know where it is! And I know how to stop it. I’ve already done it! The pressure is gone. What a relief! I burned the meadow and checked the water. The pond was filled with green algae! It had to be it. I poured rocket fuel on it, and the pressure disappeared. The place is peaceful now. I’m so relieved.

The idea came from seeing rocket fuel splash on the stream bank and remembering the early feelings of pain. The algae couldn’t help being curious once my jets mutated it. It’s dead now, burned away. I’m tired but happy it’s over.

I got a reply to my signal! They’re coming in a week. I won’t take this journal with me. Maybe I’ll leave it as a time capsule. It could be interesting for someone to find someday.

The manuscript ends here. The man wasn’t mad. He left something valuable behind. Some cells survived and spread. We’d honor him if we knew where he came from. But we don’t have records of the names he mentioned, and many planets are called “Earth.” It’s strange his race didn’t last. They had many advantages, but we’re strong because we work together.

“United, cohesive cooperation is the source of irresistible strength.”

THE END",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the protagonist's struggle for survival and sanity after crash-landing on an alien planet. This conflict is both external and internal. Externally, the protagonist faces the immediate threat of an unknown, intelligent life form (the algae) that seems to be exerting a psychological pressure on him. This creates a life-threatening situation as he battles the unsettling feeling of being watched and eventually discovers that this life form is hostile.

Internally, the protagonist grapples with isolation, fear, and the psychological toll of being entirely alone on a foreign planet. His mental state deteriorates as he tries to cope with the constant fear and the sensation of being observed by an unseen presence. This internal conflict is highlighted by his longing for human companionship and his struggle to maintain his sanity in an environment devoid of other people.

The story's dilemma extends to the broader theme of human connection and cooperation. The protagonist realizes the importance of unity and teamwork, which is underscored by the concluding line about the strength that comes from ""united, cohesive cooperation."" This ties back to the historical reference to Lincoln and suggests a universal truth that transcends time and space.","You're alone on an alien world, but something you can't see is watching you.

096.txt,"The bar didn’t have a name. It didn’t have any kind of name at all. On the outside, it just said:

Cafe  
EAT  
*Cocktails*

which doesn’t make a lot of sense. But it was a bar. It had a big TV set going ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta in three bright colors, and a jukebox trying to drown out the TV with its loud music. Anyway, it wasn’t a place for kids. I kind of liked it. But I wasn’t supposed to be there at all; it was in the contract. I was supposed to stay in New York and the New England states.

Cafe-EAT-*Cocktails* was right across the river. I think the name of the place was Hoboken, but I’m not sure. It all felt kind of dreamy. I was—

Well, I couldn’t even remember getting there. One minute I was in downtown New York, looking across the river. I did that a lot. And then I was there. I don’t remember crossing the river at all.

I was drunk, you know.

---

You know how it is? Double bourbons and keep them coming. After a while, the bartender stops bringing me the ginger ale because I forget to mix them. I got pretty loaded long before I left New York. I realize that. I guess I had to get pretty loaded to risk losing the pension and all.

I didn’t always drink a lot, but now, I don’t know, when I have one drink, I start thinking about Sam, Wally, Chowderhead, Gilvey, and the captain. If I don’t drink, I think about them too, and then I take a drink. And that leads to another drink, and it all comes out the same. Well, I guess I said it already, I drink a lot, but you can’t blame me.

There was a girl.

I always find a girl somewhere. Usually, they aren’t much, and this one wasn’t either. I mean, she was probably somebody’s mom. She was around thirty-five and not so bad, though she had a long scar under her ear down along her throat to the little round spot where her larynx was. It wasn’t ugly. She smelled nice—while I could still smell, you know—and she didn’t talk much. I liked that. Only—

Well, have you ever met someone with a nervous cough? Like when you say something a little funny, not hilarious, they don’t laugh, and they don’t just smile, but they sort of cough? She did that. I began to itch. I couldn’t help it. I asked her to stop it.

She spilled her drink and looked at me almost as though she was scared—and I had tried to say it quietly, too.

“Sorry,” she said, a little angry, a little scared. “*Sorry.* But you don’t have to—”

“Forget it.”

“Sure. But you asked me to sit down here with you, remember? If you’re going to—”

“*Forget it!*” I nodded at the bartender and held up two fingers. “You need another drink,” I said. “The thing is,” I said, “Gilvey used to do that.”

“What?”

“That cough.”

She looked puzzled. “You mean like this?”

“*Goddam it, stop it!*” Even the bartender looked over at me that time. Now she was really mad, but I didn’t want her to go away. I said, “Gilvey was a fellow who went to Mars with me. Pat Gilvey.”

“*Oh.*” She sat down again and leaned across the table, low. “*Mars.*”

---

The bartender brought our drinks and looked at me suspiciously. I said, “Say, Mac, would you turn down the air-conditioning?”

“My name isn’t Mac. No.”

“Have a heart. It’s too cold in here.”

“Sorry.” He didn’t sound sorry.

I was cold. I mean that kind of weather, it’s always cold in those places. You know around New York in August? It hits eighty, eighty-five, ninety. All the places have air-conditioning and what they really want is for you to wear a shirt and tie.

But I like to walk a lot. You would, too, you know. And you can’t walk around much in long pants and a suit coat and all that stuff. Not around there. Not in August. And so then, when I went into a bar, it’d have one of those built-in freezers for the used-car salesmen with their dates, or maybe their wives, all dressed up. For what? But I froze.

“*Mars,*” the girl breathed. “*Mars.*”

I began to itch again. “Want to dance?”

“They don’t have a license,” she said. “Byron, *I* didn’t know you’d been to *Mars*! Please *tell* me about it.”

“It was all right,” I said.

That was a lie.

She was interested. She forgot to smile. It made her look nicer. She said, “I knew a man—my brother-in-law—he was my husband’s brother—I mean my ex-husband—”

“I get the idea.”

“He worked for General Atomic. In Rockford, Illinois. You know where that is?”

“Sure.” I couldn’t go there, but I knew where Illinois was.

“He worked on the first Mars ship. Oh, fifteen years ago, wasn’t it? He always wanted to go himself, but he couldn’t pass the tests.” She stopped and looked at me.

I knew what she was thinking. But I didn’t always look this way, you know. Not that there’s anything wrong with me now, I mean, but I couldn’t pass the tests anymore. Nobody can. That’s why we’re all one-trippers.

I said, “The only reason I’m shaking like this is because I’m cold.”

It wasn’t true, of course. It was that cough of Gilvey’s. I didn’t like to think about Gilvey, or Sam or Chowderhead or Wally or the captain. I didn’t like to think about any of them. It made me shake.

You see, we couldn’t kill each other. They wouldn’t let us do that. Before we took off, they did something to our minds to make sure. What they did doesn’t last forever. It lasts for two years and then it wears off. That’s long enough, you see, because that gets you to Mars and back; and it’s plenty long enough, in another way, because it’s like a straitjacket.

You know how to make a baby cry? Hold his hands. It’s the most basic thing there is. What they did to us so we couldn’t kill each other, it was like being tied up, like having our hands held so we couldn’t get free. Well. But two years was long enough. Too long.

The bartender came over and said, “Pal, I’m sorry. See, I turned the air-conditioning down. You all right? You look so—”

I said, “Sure, I’m all right.”

He sounded worried. I hadn’t even heard him come back. The girl was looking worried, too, I guess because I was shaking so hard I was spilling my drink. I put some money on the table without even counting it.

“It’s all right,” I said. “We were just going.”

“We were?” She looked confused. But she came along with me. They always do, once they find out you’ve been to Mars.

---

In the next place, she said, between trips to the powder room, “It must take a lot of courage to sign up for something like that. Were you scientifically inclined in school? Don’t you have to know an awful lot to be a space-flyer? Did you ever see any of those little monkey characters they say live on Mars? I read an article about how they lived in little cities of pup-tents or something like that—only they didn’t make them, they grew them. Funny! Ever see those? That trip must have been a real drag, I bet. What is it, nine months? You couldn’t have a baby! Excuse me— Say, tell me. All that time, how’d you—well, manage things? I mean didn’t you ever have to go to the you-know or anything?”

“We managed,” I said.

She giggled, and that reminded her, so she went to the powder room again. I thought about getting up and leaving while she was gone, but what was the use of that? I’d only pick up somebody else.

It was nearly midnight. A couple of minutes wouldn’t hurt. I reached in my pocket for the little box of pills they give us—it isn’t refillable, but we get a new prescription in the mail every month, along with the pension check. The label on the box said:

CAUTION

*Use only as directed by physician. Not to be taken by persons suffering heart condition, digestive upset or circulatory disease. Not to be used in conjunction with alcoholic beverages.*

I took three of them. I don’t like to start them before midnight, but anyway, I stopped shaking.

I closed my eyes, and then I was on the ship again. The noise in the bar became the noise of the rockets and the air washers and the sludge sluicers. I began to sweat, although this place was air-conditioned, too.

I could hear Wally whistling to himself the way he did, the sound muffled by his oxygen mask and drowned in the rocket noise, but still perfectly audible. The tune was *Sophisticated Lady*. Sometimes it was *Easy to Love* and sometimes *Chasing Shadows*, but mostly *Sophisticated Lady*. He was from Juilliard.

Somebody sneezed, and it sounded just like Chowderhead sneezing. You know how everybody sneezes according to his own individual style? Chowderhead had a ladylike little sneeze; it went *hutta*, real quick, all through the mouth, no nose involved. The captain went *Hrasssh*; Wally was *Ashoo, ashoo, ashoo*. Gilvey was *Hutch-uh*. Sam didn’t sneeze much, but he sort of coughed and sprayed, and that was worse.

Sometimes I used to think about killing Sam by tying him down and having Wally and the captain sneeze him to death. But that was a kind of a joke, naturally, when I was feeling good. Or pretty good. Usually, I thought about a knife for Sam. For Chowderhead, it was a gun, right in the belly, one shot. For Wally, it was a tommy gun—just stitching him up and down, you know, back and forth. The captain I would put in a cage with hungry lions, and Gilvey I’d strangle with my bare hands. That was probably because of the cough, I guess.

---

She was back. “Please tell me about it,” she begged. “I’m *so* curious.”

I opened my eyes. “You want me to tell you about it?”

“Oh, please!”

“About what it’s like to fly to Mars on a rocket?”

“Yes!”

“All right,” I said.

It’s amazing what three little white pills can do. I wasn’t even shaking.

“There are six men, see? In a space the size of a Buick, and that’s all the room there is. Two of us in the bunks all the time, four of us on watch. Maybe you want to stay in the sack an extra ten minutes—because it’s the only place on the ship where you can stretch out, you know, the only place where you can rest without somebody’s elbow in your side. But you can’t. Because by then it’s the next man’s turn.

“And maybe you don’t have elbows in your side while it’s your turn off watch, but in the starboard bunk there’s the air-regenerator master valve—I bet I could still show you the bruises right around my kidneys—and in the port bunk there’s the emergency-escape-hatch handle. That gets you right in the temple if you turn your head too fast.

“And you can’t really sleep, I mean not soundly, because of the noise. That is, when the rockets are going. When they aren’t going, then you’re in free-fall, and that’s bad, too, because you dream about falling. But when they’re going, I don’t know, I think it’s worse. It’s pretty loud.

“And even if it weren’t for the noise, if you sleep too soundly you might roll over on your oxygen line. Then you dream about drowning. Ever do that? You’re strangling and choking and you can’t get any air? It isn’t dangerous, I guess. Anyway, it always woke me up in time. Though I heard about a fellow in a flight six years ago—

“Well. So you’ve always got this oxygen mask on, all the time, except if you take it off for a second to talk to somebody. You don’t do that very often, because what is there to say? Oh, maybe the first couple of weeks, sure—everybody’s friends then. You don’t even need the mask, for that matter. Or not very much. Everybody’s still pretty clean. The place smells—oh, let’s see—about like the locker room in a gym. You know? You can stand it. That’s if nobody’s got space sickness, of course. We were lucky that way.

“But that’s about how it’s going to get anyway, you know. Outside the masks, it’s soup. It isn’t that you smell it so much. You kind of *taste* it, in the back of your mouth, and your eyes sting. That’s after the first two or three months. Later on, it gets worse.

“And with the mask on, of course, the oxygen mixture is coming in under pressure. That’s funny if you’re not used to it. Your lungs have to work a little bit harder to get rid of it, especially when you’re asleep, so after a while, the muscles get sore. And then they get sorer. And then—

“Well.

“Before we take off, the psych people give us a long doo-da that keeps us from killing each other. But they can’t stop us from thinking about it. And afterward, after we’re back on Earth—this is what you won’t read about in the articles—they keep us apart. You know how they work it? We get a pension, naturally. I mean there’s got to be a pension, otherwise, there isn’t enough money in the world to make anybody go. But in the contract, it says to get the pension we have to stay in our own area.

[Illustration]

“The whole country’s marked off. Six sections. Each has at least one big city in it. I was lucky, I got a lot of them. They try to keep it so every man’s hometown is in his own section, but—well, like with us, Chowderhead and the captain both happened to come from Santa Monica. I think it was Chowderhead that got California, Nevada, all that Southwest area. It was the luck of the draw. God knows what the captain got.

“Maybe New Jersey,” I said, and took another white pill.

---

We went on to another place and she said suddenly, “I figured something out. The way you keep looking around.”

“What did you figure out?”

“Well, part of it was what you said about the other fellow getting New Jersey. This is New Jersey. You don’t belong in this section, right?”

“Right,” I said after a minute.

“So why are you here? I know why. You’re here because you’re looking for somebody.”

“That’s right.”

She said triumphantly, “You want to find that other fellow from your crew! You want to fight him!”

I couldn’t help shaking, white pills or no white pills. But I had to correct her.

“No. I want to kill him.”

“How do you know he’s here? He’s got a lot of states to roam around in, too, doesn’t he?”

“Six. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland—all the way down to Washington.”

“Then how do you know—”

“He’ll be here.” I didn’t have to tell her how I knew. But I knew.

I wasn’t the only one who spent his time at the border of his assigned area, looking across the river or staring across a state line, knowing that somebody was on the other side. I knew. You fight a war and you don’t have to guess that the enemy might have his troops a thousand miles away from the battle line. You know where his troops will be. You know he wants to fight, too.

*Hutta. Hutta.*

I spilled my drink.

I looked at her. “You—you didn’t—”

She looked frightened. “What’s the matter?”

“*Did you just sneeze?*”

“Sneeze? Me? Did I—”

I said something quick and nasty, I don’t know what. No! It hadn’t been her. I knew it.

It was Chowderhead’s sneeze.

---

Chowderhead. Marvin T. Roebuck, his name was. Five feet eight inches tall. Dark-complected, with a cast in one eye. Spoke with a Midwest kind of accent, even though he came from California—“shrick” for “shriek,” “hawror” for “horror,” like that. It drove me crazy after a while. Maybe that gives you an idea of what he talked about mostly. A skunk. A thoroughgoing, deep-rooted, mother-murdering skunk.

I kicked over my chair and roared, “Roebuck! Where are you, damn you?”

The bar was all at once silent. Only the jukebox kept going.

“I know you’re here!” I screamed. “Come out and get it! You louse, I told you I’d get you for calling me a liar the day Wally sneaked a smoke!”

Silence, everybody looking at me.

Then the door of the men’s room opened.

He came out.

He looked *lousy*. Eyes all red-rimmed and his hair falling out—the poor crumb couldn’t have been over twenty-nine. He shrieked, “You!” He called me a million names. He said, “You thieving rat, I’ll teach you to try to cheat me out of my candy ration!”

He had a knife.

I didn’t care. I didn’t have anything, and that was stupid, but it didn’t matter. I got a bottle of beer from the next table and smashed it against the back of a chair. It made a good weapon, you know; I’d take that against a knife any time.

I ran toward him, and he came all staggering and lurching toward me, looking crazy and desperate, mumbling and raving—I could hardly hear him because I was talking, too. Nobody tried to stop us. Somebody went out the door, and I figured it was to call the cops, but that was all right. Once I took care of Chowderhead, I didn’t care what the cops did.

I went for the face.

He cut me first. I felt the knife slide up along my left arm, but you know, it didn’t even hurt, only kind of stung a little. I didn’t care about that. I got him in the face, and the bottle came away, and it was all like gray and white jelly, and then blood began to spring out. He screamed. Oh, that scream! I never heard anything like that scream. It was what I had been waiting all my life for.

I kicked him as he staggered back, and he fell. And I was on top of him, with the bottle, and I was careful to stay away from the heart or the throat, because that was too quick, but I worked over the face, and I felt his knife get me a couple times more, and—

And—

---

And I woke up, you know. And there was Dr. Santly over me with a hypodermic needle that he’d just taken out of my arm, and four male nurses in fatigues holding me down. And I was drenched with sweat.

For a minute, I didn’t know where I was. It was a horrible queasy falling sensation, as though the bar and the fight and the world were all dissolving into smoke around me.

Then I knew where I was.

It was almost worse.

I stopped yelling and just lay there, looking up at them.

Dr. Santly said, trying to keep his face friendly and noncommittal, “You’re doing much better, Byron, boy. *Much* better.”

I didn’t say anything.

He said, “You worked through the whole thing in two hours and eight minutes. Remember the first time? You were sixteen hours killing him. Captain Van Wyck it was that time, remember? Who was it this time?”

“Chowderhead.” I looked at the male nurses. Doubtfully, they let go of my arms and legs.

“Chowderhead,” said Dr. Santly. “Oh—Roebuck. That boy,” he said mournfully, his expression saddened, “he’s not coming along nearly as well as you. *Nearly.* He can’t run through a cycle in less than five hours. And, that’s peculiar, it’s usually you he— Well, I better not say that, shall I? No sense setting up a counter-impression when your pores are all open, so to speak?” He smiled at me, but he was a little worried in back of the smile.

I sat up. “Anybody got a cigarette?”

“Give him a cigarette, Johnson,” the doctor ordered the male nurse standing alongside my right foot.

Johnson did. I fired up.

“You’re coming along *splendidly*,” Dr. Santly said. He was one of these psych guys that thinks if you say it’s so, it makes it so. You know that kind? “We’ll have you down under an hour before the end of the week. That’s *marvelous* progress. Then we can work on the conscious level! You’re doing extremely well, whether you know it or not. Why, in six months—say in eight months, because I like to be conservative—” he twinkled at me—“we’ll have you out of here! You’ll be the first of your crew to be discharged, you know that?”

“That’s nice,” I said. “The others aren’t doing so well?”

“No. Not at all well, most of them. Particularly Dr. Gilvey. The run-throughs leave him in terrible shape. I don’t mind admitting I’m worried about him.”

“That’s nice,” I said, and this time I meant it.

---

He looked at me thoughtfully, but all he did was say to the male nurses, “He’s all right now. Help him off the table.”

It was hard standing up. I had to hold onto the rail around the table for a minute. I said my set little speech: “Dr. Santly, I want to tell you again how grateful I am for this. I was reconciled to living the rest of my life confined to one part of the country, the way the other crews always did. But this is much better. I appreciate it. I’m sure the others do, too.”

“Of course, boy. Of course.” He took out a fountain pen and made a note on my chart; I couldn’t see what it was, but he looked gratified. “It’s no more than you have coming to you, Byron,” he said. “I’m grateful that I could be the one to make it come to pass.”

He glanced conspiratorially at the male nurses. “You know how important this is to me. It’s the triumph of a whole new approach to psychic rehabilitation. I mean to say our heroes of space travel are entitled to freedom when they come back home to Earth, aren’t they?”

“Definitely,” I said, scrubbing some of the sweat off my face onto my sleeve.

“So we’ve got to end this system of designated areas. We can’t avoid the tensions that accompany space travel, no. But if we can help you eliminate harmful tensions with a few run-throughs, why, it’s not too high a price to pay, is it?”

“Not a bit.”

“I mean to say,” he said, warming up, “you can look forward to the time when you’ll be able to mingle with your old friends from the rocket, free and easy, without any need for restraint. That’s a lot to look forward to, isn’t it?”

“It is,” I said. “I look forward to it very much,” I said. “And I know exactly what I’m going to do the first time I meet one—I mean without any restraints, as you say,” I said. And it was true; I did. Only it wouldn’t be a broken beer bottle that I would do it with.

I had much more elaborate ideas than that.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the psychological and emotional aftermath of a space mission to Mars. The protagonist, Byron, grapples with intense feelings of animosity and unresolved tension toward his former crew members. The story reveals that these astronauts were subjected to psychological conditioning to prevent them from harming each other during their mission. However, once they return to Earth, they are left with lingering hatred and a desire for retribution that they cannot act upon due to geographical restrictions and psychiatric interventions.

Byron's internal struggle is compounded by his dependence on alcohol and medication to cope with his trauma and the confines of his designated living area, which is part of a system designed to keep the crew members separated. The story illustrates his yearning for freedom from these constraints, both physically and mentally, as well as his deep-seated desire to confront and possibly harm his former crew members.

The external conflict is further heightened by the story's setting, where Byron is not supposed to be, and his encounter with a woman at a bar, which triggers memories of his traumatic space mission. This leads to a hallucinatory episode where he imagines a violent confrontation with a crew member, reflecting his unresolved psychological turmoil. Ultimately, the story explores themes of trauma, isolation, and the challenges of reintegration into society after a harrowing experience.",What if the only thing stopping you from harming someone was a line on a map?

097.txt,"Among the metal people of Phobos, robot B-12 had a special place. He wasn't the strongest, biggest, or fastest, but he was clever, and importantly, he was the only moonshiner on that junkyard planetoid.

I am B-12, a metal person. If you read _Day_ and other journals, you might know that some parts of the galaxy hold prejudice against us. It's always like this with minority groups, but I’m not complaining—just explaining, so you understand about the alarm clock.

An alarm clock is a simple device used by the Builders to wake themselves up after sleeping. It's old-fashioned but still used in far-off places like Phobos.

Here's how I encountered one:

I sneaked into Argon City at night—wise in my line of work—and moved quietly through alleys, my rusty joints creaking slightly.

I was almost at Benny's Place, still unnoticed, when I passed a lit window. Naturally, being drawn to light, I stopped to look, resting my grapples on the ledge.

Inside was a Builder I hadn’t seen in fifty years since coming to Phobos, but I recognized her type immediately. She was a ""she.""

She was taking off some outer clothes, and I noticed she was symmetrical but oddly shaped—larger in the front than I remembered seeing on Earth.

I watched for a few minutes, forgetting my own safety, when she saw me. Her eyes widened, and she grabbed the alarm clock nearby.

""Get out of here, you nosy old tin can!"" she screamed, throwing the clock. It hit my head, damaging an earphone. I ran.

If you don’t understand yet about racial prejudice, you will when you hear what happened later.

I continued to Benny's Place, entering through the back. Benny met me and quickly led me to a side room. His glowing eyes showed he was excited.

Benny’s real name is BNE-96, and he was only a Servitor on Earth, not a General Purpose like me.

I should explain. We metal people are created by the Builders of Earth, Mars, and Venus. We weren’t born of parents like they are; we were made by scientists. You might think we’d be seen as superior, but we’re not.

Many of us were created for specific tasks, and some, like me, could do almost anything. We were content, mostly, but the scientists kept creating, trying to improve.

Eventually, the Builders knew what would happen: we became obsolete. More than fifty thousand of us were no longer needed. The new models with fresh brains did things better.

We were sent to Phobos, a barren moon of Mars, which was a junkyard and became our graveyard.

On this lifeless world, only a few Martian and Terran prospectors searched for minerals. Small mining communities like Argon City sprang up under domes but never thrived.

Can you imagine our loneliness? Fifty thousand skilled workers with nothing to do. Some gave up, rusting away on the rocks. Others served miners, but their needs were few.

Most of us were idle, but we learned to serve each other.

This was hard to learn. We needed motivation to exist as a race. We didn’t sleep, eat, or reproduce. (Reproducing would have been pointless for us.)

However, there was one Builder pleasure that interested us: the stimulation from drenching their insides with alcohol, a pastime for many males and some females.

One of us, R-47, tried it. He poured a bottle into his mechanism.

Poor R-47. He caught fire and burned up. We couldn’t save him.

But his sacrifice wasn’t in vain. He gave us an idea. An idea that led to Moon Glow. My discovery, really, as I was the first.

I can’t reveal my secret formula for Moon Glow. There are many kinds now, but only one B-12 Moon Glow.

It’s a high-octane preparation that, with just a drop, makes you feel alive and free. You feel strong and happy. Old joints move freely, circuits glow, and body currents race smoothly. Moon Glow is like being born again.

Selling it is illegal now, for no reason except the Builders, who make the laws, can’t stand to see us have fun.

Some blame falls on individuals like X-101, who insists on dancing when he's had Moon Glow, risking everyone's toes. Or DC-5, who once tore down a building after over-indulging.

I don’t feel responsible for these things. If I didn’t sell the Moon Glow, someone else would. Besides, I’m just a wholesaler. Benny buys all I produce in my lab hidden in the Dumps.

Right now, Benny seemed worried. ""What’s wrong?"" I asked. ""Is it the revenue agents?""

""I don’t know,"" said BNE-96 in his flat voice. ""But important visitors from Earth are here. It could mean trouble. Jon tipped me off.""

He meant Jon Rogeson, the peace officer here in Argon City, the only Builder who didn’t look down on us. When sober, he always watched out for us.

""What are they like?"" I asked, worried, as I had six vials of Moon Glow with me.

""I haven’t seen them, but there’s one high in the government and his wife. Other Builders and a new type metal person are with them.""

I had met the wife. ""They hate us,"" I said. ""We can expect only trouble.""

""You might be right. If you have merchandise, I’ll take it, but don’t risk bringing more here until they’re gone.""

I gave him the vials, and he paid me in credits, good for fuel refills.

Benny stored the vials and went into the bar. There was the usual crowd of miners and metal people seeking company. I recognized many, though I rarely spent time there, preferring solitude, distilling Moon Glow, and studying in the barrens.

Jon Rogeson saw me and signaled me over. I went to his table. He was pleasant-looking as Builders go, with blue eyes and unruly hair.

""Sit down,"" he said, smiling.

I never sit, but I did to be polite. I was cautious, sensing something unpleasant. I wondered if he knew about the Moon Glow. Maybe he had some power to see through walls, though I’d never heard of a Builder like that. I knew he suspected me of making Moon Glow.

""What do you want?"" I asked.

""Relax,"" he said. ""Loosen up and be friendly.""

That made me feel good. I felt young, as if I had taken Moon Glow myself.

""Actually, B-12,"" he said, ""I want a favor.""

""What is it?""

""You might have heard about important visitors from Earth.""

""I’ve heard nothing,"" I said. It’s useful to appear ignorant sometimes, as Builders think we can’t lie. But we General Purposes can lie well.

""Well, there is. A Senator, Simon F. Langley. I’m supposed to entertain them; that’s where you come in.""

I was puzzled. I imagined myself singing or dancing for the Senator, but I can’t sing well, and lateral movement is hard for me now. ""I don’t understand,"" I said. ""There’s J-66. He was an entertainer—""

""No, no!"" he interrupted. ""The Senator wants a guide. They’re surveying the Dumps, and you know the Dumps better than anyone on Phobos.""

So that was it. I felt a vague dread. I had such feelings before, usually with reason. I had learned much from studying Builders, but Jon’s eyes showed no trickery.

Yet I felt something bad was near. It was brief, but clear.

I said I’d think it over.

Senator Langley was distinguished, Jon said. But he was round and talked endlessly about things I didn’t understand. His wife was younger, sullen, and I sensed a connection between her and Jon.

There were other humans—no Builders, as I didn’t see them as superior. They wore glasses and stayed close to the Senator like moons, clearly servitors.

I won’t describe them further.

MS-33 I will describe. I disliked him immediately. He was slim, shiny, and smug. He was the new type, replacing us on Earth. He flaunted his knowledge.

We didn’t go far that first morning. The half-track took us to the Dumps’ edge. Inside, you walk or don’t go. Phobos has no air, and rockets aren’t practical. The terrain is rocky, littered with the refuse of many worlds, but the Dumps—that’s different.

Imagine a sea of rusting ships, worn-out machinery, and my kind whose power packs failed or who gave up. A more somber sight you’ve never seen.

But Langley, the Builder, sickened me. This round, impractical man rubbed his hands with glee. ""Excellent,"" he said. ""Far better than I hoped."" He didn’t explain.

I looked at Jon. He shook his head.

""You there—robot!"" Langley said to me. ""How far across this place?"" The word felt like a slap. I couldn’t answer.

MS-33 clanked up to me, gripping me and shaking me. ""Speak when spoken to, old machine!"" he grated.

I wanted to hit him, but what use against my aging limbs?

Jon Rogeson came to my aid. ""Here on Phobos, we don’t use ‘robot.’ They’ve been free a long time. They like ‘metal people.’ Just a custom, but if you want to get along—""

""Can they vote?"" Langley laughed at his own joke.

""Nonsense,"" said MS-33. ""I’m a robot, and proud. This rusty piece has no right to airs.""

""Release him,"" Langley said. ""Droll fellows, these old robots. Like mechanical dolls, really, but the scientists erred giving them human traits.""

True enough, from his view. We had been mechanical dolls, I suppose, but fifty years can change one. We think, feel, and are happy or sad, often bored with life on Phobos.

It burned me. My cells throbbed hot, and I decided to learn more about Langley’s mission and get even with MS-33, even if it meant being dismantled.

The rest of that week was unpleasant. We went out daily, Langley’s servants measuring and exchanging looks behind their glasses. It was mysterious. And troubling.

But I couldn’t discover the mission. When I asked MS-33, he stayed silent, looking important. Somehow, it seemed vital to find out what was happening before it was too late.

On the third day, something odd happened. My friend Jon Rogeson had been taking pictures. Langley and his wife were talking quietly. Jon, without thinking, turned the camera on them and clicked.

Langley turned red and said, ""What are you doing?""

""Nothing,"" said Jon.

""You took my picture,"" growled Langley. ""Give me the film.""

Jon reddened too. He wasn’t used to orders. ""I’ll be damned if I will,"" he said.

Langley muttered something and turned away. His wife looked startled and worried, her eyes pleading with Jon. There was a message, but I couldn’t read it. Jon looked away.

Langley walked back to the half-track alone, turning once with evil in his eyes toward Jon. ""You’ll lose your job for this,"" he said savagely, adding, ""not that there’ll be a job after this week.""

Builders might seem unreasonable, but there's always a reason in their brains if you can find it. I knew this from studying them, and certain ideas came to me, interesting even if unproven.

The time had come to act. I could barely wait for darkness. I was sure I’d been right. Something was about to happen to Phobos, to all of us—I didn’t know what, but I had to stop it.

I stayed in Argon City’s shadows and found the window easily. The place where I’d seen Langley’s wife before. There was no one inside; it was dark, but I wasn’t deterred.

Inside the airdrome, buildings are loosely made, like on Earth. I opened the window and climbed in. I found the door I sought and searched thoroughly, not finding what I primarily sought—Langley’s mission reason. But in a metallic bag, I found something else, making my power pack hum loudly. It explained the Senator’s strangeness today—explained many things and made my brain race with new ideas.

I put it in my chest container and left as stealthily as I’d come. There had been progress, but not finding what I hoped, I must try my alternate plan.

Two hours later, I found who I sought, making sure he saw me. Then I left Argon City by the South lock, like a thief, always checking over my shoulder. When I was sure I was followed, I went fast, soon clambering over debris heaps at the Dumps’ edge.

I thought I heard footsteps, but saw no one. Just the tiny disk of Deimos over the nearest ridge, the sky outlining the moon’s curve.

Soon, I reached home, the ancient star freighter hull on a junk heap. It would never rise again, but its shell was strong enough to shelter my distillery and few belongings from meteors.

I greeted it warmly, as one does the familiar. I stumbled over tangled metal, eager to get there.

It was as I left it. The heating element under the coils and pressure chambers glowed, and the Moon Glow dripped musically into the retort.

I felt good. No one bothered me here. This was my fortress, with all I cared for inside. My tools, my work, my tiny library. Yet I had deliberately—

Something—a heavy foot—clanked on the manport step.

I turned quickly. The form shimmered in the pale Deimos light, outlining it.

MS-33.

He had followed me.

""What do you want?"" I said. ""What are you doing here?""

""A simple question,"" said MS-33. ""Tonight you looked suspicious leaving Argon City. I saw you and followed you. I’ve never trusted you. All the old ones were unreliable. That’s why you were replaced.""

He entered boldly, uninvited, and looked around. I detected a sneer as he said, ""So this is where you hide.""

""I don’t hide. I live here, it’s true.""

""A robot doesn’t live. A robot exists. We newer models don’t need shelter like an animal. We’re rust-proof and invulnerable."" He strode to my library, fingering the spools irreverently. ""What’s this?""

""My library.""

""So! Our memories are built-in. We don’t need refreshers.""

""So is mine,"" I said. ""But I want to learn more."" I was stalling for time, waiting for the right moment.

""Nonsense,"" he said. ""I know why you stay here in the Dumps, masterless. I’ve heard of the forbidden drug sold in Argon City. Is this it?"" He pointed to the still.

Now was the time. I gathered my cunning but couldn’t speak. Not yet.

""Never mind,"" he said. ""I see it is. I’ll report you. It’ll please me to see you dismantled. Not that it matters, now.""

There it was again. The same frightening hint Langley had made. I must succeed!

I knew MS-33, despite his brilliance, newness, and superiority, was only a Secretarial. General Purpose models weren’t made anymore. That’s why we survived on Phobos. We had something special the new ones didn’t. MS-33’s weakness: he couldn’t be devious.

""You’re right,"" I said, pretending resignation. ""This is my distillery. It’s where I make Moon Glow. You might want to learn how it works.""

""Not remotely interested,"" he said. ""I want to take you back to the authorities.""

""It’s like Earth’s distilling plants,"" I said, ""but the main ingredient, a silicon compound, is irradiated through zirconium tubes to the heating pile, breaking into Moon Glow droplets. See the golden drops falling there.

""It tastes like fine petroleum, as I make it. Maybe you’d like to try it. Then you’d see it’s not bad. Maybe you’d be lenient.""

""Certainly not,"" said MS-33.

""Perhaps you’re right,"" I said. I took a syringe, drew several drops, and injected into my carapace. I felt much better.

""Yes,"" I continued, ""certainly you’re right. You newer models couldn’t stand it. You weren’t built for it. Nor could you enjoy Moon Glow’s joys. Not only would you find no pleasure, but it’d corrode your parts until you could barely crawl back for repairs."" I helped myself to another portion.

""That’s the silliest thing I’ve heard,"" he said.

""What?""

""I said, it’s silly. We withstand a hundred times more stress and twice as many chemicals as you. Nothing could harm us. Besides, it looks harmless. I doubt it’s hardly anything.""

""For me, it’s not,"" I admitted. ""But you—""

""Give me the syringe, fool!""

""I dare not.""

""Give it here!""

I let him take it. I couldn’t stop him. He shoved me against the bulkhead. He filled the syringe with Moon Glow, opened a plate in his ventral area, and injected himself.

It was quite a dose. He waited. ""I feel nothing,"" he said. ""I don’t believe it’s more than oil."" He was silent. ""There is an ease of movement,"" he said.

""No paralysis?"" I asked.

""Paral—? You rusty old robot!"" He helped himself to more Moon Glow. The stuff was costly, but I didn’t begrudge it.

His joints flexed, and his power unit whined. He took a sidestep, looking at his feet, arms held out.

""The gravity here is superb,"" he said, skipping.

""Isn't it?"" I said.

""Almost negligible,"" he said.

""True.""

""You’ve been kind to me,"" MS-33 said. ""Extraordinarily kind."" He used all his memory pack adjectives. ""I wonder if you’d mind terribly if—""

""Not at all,"" I said. ""Help yourself. By the way, friend, would you mind saying what your party’s mission is here? The Senator forgot to mention.""

""Secret,"" he said. ""Top secret. As a loyal servant, I couldn’t divulge it. If I could—"" his eyes glistened, ""you’d be the first to know. The very first."" He put an arm around my shoulder.

""I see,"" I said, ""and what is it you’re not allowed to tell me?""

""That we’re surveying Phobos to see if it’s worth sending salvage for scrap. Earth needs metal, and it depends on the master’s report.""

""They’ll take all the derelict ships and equipment?""

""And the robots,"" MS-33 said. ""They’re metal too.""

""They’re taking dismantled robots?""

MS-33 gestured. ""They’ll take all the robots, dismantled or not. They’re useless. The bill’s before Congress and will pass if my master says so."" He patted my helmet. ""If you were worth a damn—""

""That’s murder,"" I said. And I meant it. Man’s inhumanity to metal people, I thought. Yes—to man, even if we were metal.

""What’s that?"" MS-33 said foggily.

""Have another drop of Moon Glow,"" I said. ""I must return to Argon City.""

I made it back to Benny’s place swiftly. I sent Benny to find Jon Rogeson, and soon he brought him back.

I told Jon what MS-33 said, watching his reaction. I couldn’t forget that though he was our friend, he was still a Builder, a human who thought as humans.

""You understand,"" I said grimly, ""that one word of this will bring an uprising of fifty-thousand metal people, costly and destructive to stop. We’re free. The Builders exiled us and lost their claim. We have a right to life, and we don’t want to be melted into machines.""

""Fools,"" Jon said softly. ""Listen, B-12, you’ve got to believe me. I didn’t know this, though I suspected something. I’m on your side, but what do we do? Maybe they’ll listen to reason. Vera—""

""That’s the she’s name? No, they won’t listen. They hate us."" I recalled the alarm clock with bitterness. ""There’s a chance, however. I’ve not been idle. If you get Langley and meet me in the back room here at Benny’s, we’ll talk.""

""But he’ll be asleep.""

""Awaken him,"" I said. ""Get him here. Your job’s at stake too, remember.""

""I’ll get him,"" Jon said. ""Wait here.""

I went to the bar where Benny served miners. Benny was my friend. Jon was too, but he was a Builder. I wanted one of my kind to know what was happening, in case something happened to me.

We talked quietly when I saw MS-33. He entered, purposeful. The Moon Glow effects had worn off faster than expected. He came for vengeance, to tell about my distillery, which would end me. I had one thing to do and fast.

""Quick,"" I told Benny. ""Douse the lights."" He did. The place darkened. I sensed everything, for I had special sensors from being a General Purpose. I worked quickly, getting what I needed. I ducked out the door and threw it far away. It was intricate, unduplicatable on Phobos.

When I returned, the lights were back on, but it didn’t matter. MS-33 sat at a table, staring at me. He said nothing. Benny motioned me to the back room. I went.

Jon Rogeson and Langley were there. Langley looked angry, muttering curses and rubbing his eyes.

Jon laughed. ""I had to arrest him to get him here. This better be good.""

""It’s all bad,"" I said, ""but necessary."" I turned to Langley. ""Your survey aims to condemn Phobos, dead and living, to Earth’s furnaces. Is this true?""

""You impudent, miserable piece of tin! What if I am making a scrap survey? What can you do? You’re nothing but a ro—""

""So it’s true! But you’ll tell the salvage ships not to come. It’s yours to decide, and you’ll decide we’re not worth the bother. You’ll save us.""

""I?"" Langley blustered.

""You will."" I took the thing from my container and showed him. He paled.

Jon said, ""Well, I’ll be damned!""

It was a picture of Langley and another. I gave it to Jon. ""His wife,"" I said. ""His real wife. See the inscription.""

""Then Vera—?""

""Isn’t his wife. You wonder why he was camera shy?""

""Housebreaker!"" Langley roared. ""It’s a plot!""

""It’s blackmail,"" I said. I turned to Jon. ""Am I right?""

""You are."" Jon said.

""You’re instructed to leave Phobos,"" I told Langley, ""and keep my friend’s job as peace officer. Without it, he’d be lost. I’ve observed in these things Builders are hardly more adaptable than us. You’ll do all this, and we won’t send the picture Jon took today to your wife, or inform her of your transgression. For I’m told this is a transgression.""

""It is,"" agreed Jon gravely. ""Right, Langley?""

""All right,"" Langley snarled. ""You win. The sooner I leave, the better."" He got up to go, squeezing out the door, past the miners and metal people. We watched him go with satisfaction.

""It’s no business of mine,"" I said to Jon, ""but I’ve seen you look at the she who wasn’t Langley’s wife. Since she’s not his, nothing stops you from having her. Shouldn’t that make you happy?""

""Are you kidding?"" he snarled.

Which proves I still have much to learn about his race.

Out front, Langley saw his metal servant, MS-33, as he left. He turned to him. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked.

MS-33 said nothing, staring at the bar, ignoring Langley.

""Come on here, damn you!"" Langley said. MS-33 stayed silent. Langley went to him, shouting foul things that would corrode one’s soul. I’ll never forget that moment. The screaming, red-faced Langley, the laughing miners.

But MS-33 never replied again. And that was no surprise, for I had removed his fuse.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the struggle for survival and dignity of the metal people on Phobos, particularly B-12, in the face of dehumanizing attitudes and existential threats from their creators, the Builders. The metal people, who were once valued workers, have been rendered obsolete and exiled to a barren moon. The arrival of Senator Langley and his entourage from Earth poses a new threat: the potential dismantling and repurposing of the metal people as scrap metal, which would effectively end their existence.

This conflict is further complicated by the prejudice and discrimination the metal people face from the Builders, who view them as inferior and disposable despite their sentience and ability to feel emotions. B-12's illegal moonshining operation, creating a substance called Moon Glow, serves as both a means of coping with their bleak existence and a symbol of their resistance against the oppressive systems that seek to control and destroy them.

The dilemma intensifies when B-12 learns of Langley's plans and must navigate the ethical and practical challenges of saving his kind. He resorts to blackmailing Langley with incriminating evidence to ensure the safety and continued existence of the metal people on Phobos.
