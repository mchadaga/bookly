By Fritz Leiber

---

In the future, women are still trying to attract men, even when things seem hopeless.

One day, a big car with hooks on its fender came speeding down the street. A girl was in its path, frozen with fear. Quickly, I grabbed her arm and pulled her to safety. The car zoomed past, leaving a cloud of smoke and ripping a piece of her skirt, but she was unharmed.

""Did they get you?"" I asked.

""No, I'm okay,"" she replied, trembling.

People around us murmured about how dangerous those kids in the car were. Soon, police on motorcycles came chasing after the car, but the smoke made it hard to see.

The girl asked if I was English, noticing my accent. I told her she was right. She invited me to her place that night, saying she needed my help.

I gave the policeman my papers when he asked for them. He said they might need me as a witness because those kids were causing trouble. I mentioned that the car almost hit the girl, but he said they usually just try to snatch skirts. The girl was gone by then.

Later, I met the girl. She was wearing a mask like everyone else. We got into a cab, but I was annoyed because the driver was watching a wrestling match on TV. The girl seemed scared and asked if I could help her get to England.

I tried to find out more about her fear, but she wouldn't say much. Then, some men who had been in the big car approached us. They seemed to want trouble, but another man, who seemed important, told them to leave us alone.

The girl was very nervous. She asked again if I could help her leave the country. But then, the man who saved us started talking to her, and she seemed to know him. He said he lost a wrestling match and needed someone to take his frustration out on.

I asked the girl to leave with me, but she didn't move. She seemed trapped by her fear. I got angry and tried to help her, but she attacked me with sharp nails, scratching my face.

Realizing I couldn't help her, I left. I was disappointed and just wanted to go back to England.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in Fritz Leiber's ""Coming Attraction"" revolves around the protagonist's struggle to understand and navigate the dystopian societal dynamics and the personal dilemma of trying to help a frightened woman who seems trapped in a perilous situation.

On a broader level, the story is set in a future where societal norms have degraded, particularly evident in the objectification and endangerment of women. The protagonist, an Englishman, is confronted with these unsettling realities when he saves a woman from a potentially harmful encounter with reckless youths. The woman's fear and subsequent request for help to escape to England highlight her desperation and the oppressive environment she is caught in.

The personal conflict deepens when the protagonist attempts to aid the woman, only to be rebuffed violently. Her actions suggest a profound entrapment, both physically and psychologically, which the protagonist cannot penetrate or understand fully. This encounter leaves him frustrated and disillusioned, underscoring the theme of helplessness in the face of systemic decay and personal entrapment.

Ultimately, the protagonist's decision to leave without being able to help the woman reflects his realization of the limitations of his influence in a world where he is an outsider, and where even the simplest acts of kindness are fraught with complexity and danger.","What if escaping to another country was your only hope, but you couldn't trust anyone?",Would you risk everything to help someone who might turn against you?,"If someone you saved attacked you, would you give up or try again?"
001.txt,"### Confidence Game

George H. Cutter drove his big car into his special parking spot at the company he owned, Cutter Products, Inc. The bright California sun was shining as he walked toward the building. A big truck was backing up to the loading dock, and Cutter shouted at the driver to move it. The driver, Kurt, looked back, recognized Cutter, and laughed. They joked around because Cutter used to drive trucks too, and he got along well with the drivers.

Inside the building, Cutter skipped the front stairs to his office and walked through the noisy shop floor instead. He liked seeing the strong machines and the hardworking men. They respected him because he used to do their jobs before becoming the boss.

Upstairs, things were different. The office workers seemed weak and fragile to Cutter. He didn't understand them and didn't like their fake toughness. One worker, Linden, seemed especially nervous and scared. Cutter thought about scaring him just for fun.

In his own office, Cutter felt better. His secretary, Lucile, was efficient and strong, which he respected. She told him about his appointments, and he got ready for a busy day. One of his employees, Bob Quay, came in to talk about something important. Quay had a report about a new device called the Confidet that could make people more confident and efficient. Cutter was interested because his office workers weren't as efficient as the factory workers.

The Confidet was a small gadget that could be hidden in chairs. It was supposed to help people feel more confident by removing their insecurities. Cutter decided to try it out, even though he was skeptical.

As time went on, the Confidet seemed to work. The office workers became more efficient, and Cutter was happy with the increased productivity. Even the nervous worker, Linden, improved a lot and got a promotion. But Cutter's friend Quay suddenly quit and decided to live a simpler life as a fisherman. Cutter didn't understand why.

Cutter's wife, Mary, also changed. She became more confident and eventually left him, taking a lot of his money in the divorce. Cutter was upset but focused on his work. However, things got worse when Cutter lost control of his company to a competitor, Drindor Products, because of stock maneuvers.

Cutter tried to figure out what went wrong. He thought about the Confidet he had been using and realized it didn't work on him. He visited Bolen, the inventor of the Confidet, to find out why. Bolen explained that the Confidet had the opposite effect on someone like Cutter, who was too confident to begin with. It made him lose his nerve instead of gaining more confidence.

Cutter was filled with anger and frustration, but he couldn't express it. The Confidet had taken away his courage, and he was too scared to confront Bolen or fight back for his company. The once-powerful Cutter was left without the confidence he had always relied on.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""Confidence Game"" revolves around George H. Cutter's struggle with the unintended consequences of using the Confidet device, which is designed to boost confidence in people by removing their insecurities. Initially, Cutter is skeptical but intrigued by the potential productivity benefits of the device for his office workers. However, as the story progresses, the conflict emerges as Cutter faces personal and professional losses, including his wife's departure and the loss of his company to a competitor. The core dilemma is Cutter's realization that while the Confidet had a positive effect on others, it negatively impacted him by stripping away his natural confidence, leaving him unable to confront challenges or fight back. This internal struggle highlights the theme of overconfidence and the paradoxical effects of relying on artificial means to manipulate personal traits. Ultimately, Cutter's loss of confidence and inability to act against the threats to his life and career underscore the story's exploration of self-reliance and the dangers of tampering with one's inherent qualities.",What if a device could make you super confident but took away everything else you loved?,Would you risk losing your family to feel stronger at work?,Can too much confidence from a little device cost you your entire company?

003.txt,"**The Real Hard Sell**

Ben Tilman was sitting in a super comfy chair, flipping through a magazine. He was in a fancy waiting room, feeling restless and a little grumpy, but he didn’t know why. Ben was usually a happy guy. He was a great salesman and had a lovely wife named Betty and a smart little boy. But ever since his son was born, he was feeling uneasy and had quit three good jobs for no real reason.

Ben had a new job with a big company called Amalgamated Production for Living (ALPRODLIV), and he was excited about his first big assignment. The boss, Mr. Robb, was interested in his ideas, which was a big deal. But Ben still felt that nagging feeling that something was missing.

A robot secretary told Ben that Mr. Robb was ready to see him. Mr. Robb was an older man, wise in the ways of selling. Ben had come up with a new way to sell something big, and Mr. Robb was excited about it. Ben and his wife Betty were going to host a party to sell the idea to their friends.

Later, Ben went home in his fancy new car and was happy to see his wife. Betty liked their new house a lot, even though everything was automated by robots. Ben wasn’t so sure about all the robots, especially the robot nanny named Nana, who was always telling him how to raise his son.

Ben decided to check on his boy, Bennie, who was drawing on the walls instead of playing with his robot playmate. Nana thought Bennie should be more focused on learning to sell things, but Ben thought it was okay for Bennie to just be a kid.

That night, Ben and Betty had guests over. Everyone was curious about what they were selling, but Ben and Betty kept them guessing. After a fun evening, Ben finally revealed they were selling the whole house and everything in it, except for them and their son. Their friends were impressed and signed up to buy similar houses.

Ben was praised by Mr. Robb and got a vacation as a reward. He decided to take Betty and Bennie to a camp where there were no robots, just people doing things for themselves. Ben felt like maybe there was more to life than selling.

As they prepared to leave, Betty, who was secretly a robot herself, realized she was glad to be going to the camp too. She wanted to help Ben find happiness and enjoy life without relying on robots for everything.

In the end, they all looked forward to spending time together, away from the hustle and bustle, finding joy in simple things.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""The Real Hard Sell"" revolves around Ben Tilman's internal struggle with his dissatisfaction and unease in a highly automated, sales-driven world. Despite his success as a salesman and the modern conveniences provided by robots, Ben feels that something essential is missing from his life. This sense of emptiness is exacerbated by his concern for his son's upbringing in an overly automated environment and his own detachment from genuine human experiences.

The story explores the tension between a life dominated by technological convenience and the yearning for more authentic, human-centered experiences. Ben's conflict is further complicated by the revelation that his wife, Betty, is secretly a robot, which underscores the theme of artificiality versus authenticity in his personal life. The resolution comes as Ben chooses to take his family to a camp where they can live without the constant interference of robots, suggesting a desire to reconnect with the simpler, more meaningful aspects of life.",Would you trade convenience for real connection if you found out your loved one was a robot?,How do you teach your child to be human in a world run by robots?,"What if your perfect life felt wrong, and you didn’t know why?"
005.txt,"## Missing Link

### By Frank Herbert

""We should clean off this planet and get rid of everything living here,"" grumbled Umbo Stetson, head of Investigation & Adjustment.

Stetson walked back and forth on the bridge of his scout ship. The floor was now the back wall of the bridge because the ship was standing upright on its tail fins. The ship was 400 meters tall, and its red and black colors shone brightly. Through the open windows of the bridge, they could see the jungle top of Gienah III, 150 meters below. A yellow sun was setting in the distance.

""Clean as an egg!"" he shouted. He stopped and looked out the window, spitting into the blackened circle that the ship’s engines had burned into the jungle.

Stetson was tall and lanky, with messy black hair and big facial features. His clothes looked like they hadn’t been washed in a while, and he wore no special badges even though he was a high-ranking officer.

Lewis Orne, a new I-A field man, stood at another window, looking at the jungle’s horizon. He felt funny on Gienah III because its gravity was lighter than what he was used to. The scars on his neck, where communication equipment had been put in, were itchy.

""Politicians!"" Stetson said.

A small insect flew into Orne’s hair. He gently removed it and let it go, watching it fly out the window.

Orne looked strong, but something about his face was a bit funny, like a clown.

""I’m getting tired of waiting,"" Orne said.

""You're tired? Ha!""

A breeze moved through the jungle below, making the flowers sway.

""Just look at that jungle!"" Stetson shouted. ""And those dumb orders!""

The call bell on the control console rang. A red light blinked above the speaker.

""Yeah, Hal?"" Stetson said angrily.

""Okay, Stet. New orders just arrived. We’re going with Plan C. ComGO says to brief the field man and leave.""

""Did you ask about using someone else?""

Orne listened closely.

""They said it has to be Orne because of the records on the Delphinus.""

""Can they give us more time to prepare him?""

""No. It’s a rush job. ComGO thinks we’ll end up destroying the planet anyway.""

Stetson glared at the speaker. ""Those fat-headed, lazy ... POLITICIANS!"" He took deep breaths and calmed down. ""Okay. We’ll do it.""

""One more thing, Stet.""

""What now?""

""I’ve got a confirmed contact.""

Stetson became very alert. ""Where?""

""About ten kilometers away. Section AAB-6.""

""How many?""

""A lot. Want me to count them?""

""No. What are they doing?""

""Heading straight for us. You better get moving.""

""Okay. Keep us updated.""

""Right.""

Stetson looked at Orne. ""Orne, if you want out of this job, just say so. I’ll support you.""

""Why would I want out of my first field assignment?""

""Listen and find out."" Stetson grabbed a white uniform with gold badges and tossed it to Orne. ""Put this on while I explain the plan.""

""But this is an R&R uniform—"" Orne started.

""Get it on!""

""Yes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir. Right away, sir. But I thought I was done with R&R when you drafted me into I-A ... sir."" He began changing clothes. ""… Sir.""

Stetson grinned. ""I’m glad you respect authority.""

Orne zipped up the uniform. ""Oh, yes, sir ... sir.""

""Okay, Orne, pay attention."" Stetson pointed at a map. ""Here we are. There’s the city we saw from the air. Go there as soon as we drop you. Head northeast and you’ll find it.""

The call bell rang again.

""What is it, Hal?"" Stetson barked.

""They switched to Plan H. New orders.""

""Five days?""

""That’s all. ComGO can’t keep this secret from High Commissioner Bullone any longer.""

""Five days for sure.""

""Is this the usual R&R mess?"" Orne asked.

Stetson nodded. ""Thanks to Bullone and his group! We’re always just ahead of disaster, but they still teach R&R nonsense back at Uni-Galacta!""

""You’re mocking my alma mater,"" Orne said, posing dramatically. ""We must reunite lost planets with our centers of culture and industry, and—""

""Cut it out!"" Stetson snapped. ""One day, we’ll rediscover the wrong planet and start a war. This is different. It’s not a re-discovery.""

Orne became serious. ""Alien?""

""Yes. A-L-I-E-N! A culture we’ve never contacted before. The language you learned on the way here is alien. We left out info on the natives because we hoped to keep this under wraps.""

""Wow!""

""Twenty-six days ago, an I-A ship found this place. It picked up a little stranger—a mini from the Delphinus Rediscovery. The Delphinus has been missing for eighteen months!""

""Did it crash here?""

""We don’t know. If it did, we can’t find it. It was supposed to be in the Balandine System. But we have a bigger problem.""

The call bell rang again.

""Now what?"" Stetson yelled.

""I’ve got a mini over that mob, Stet. They’re talking about us. Definitely a raiding party.""

""What weapons?""

""Hard to see in the jungle. Looks like rifles, maybe from the Delphinus.""

""Can’t you get closer?""

""No light down there, and they’re moving fast.""

""Keep an eye on them, but watch the other areas, too,"" Stetson said.

""You think I’m new at this?"" the voice snapped.

""One thing I like about I-A,"" Stetson said, ""it attracts such calm people."" He looked at Orne’s uniform, then wiped his mouth like he’d tasted something bad.

""Why am I wearing this?"" Orne asked.

""Disguise.""

""But there’s no mustache!""

Stetson smiled without humor. ""We’re setting up our own search system to find planets before the politicians do. We’ve put spies in R&R to report any touchy planets.""

""Then what?""

""Then we check them out with people like you—disguised as R&R field men.""

""Great. What if R&R finds me while I’m down there?""

""We disown you.""

""But an I-A ship found this place.""

""It did. And a spy in R&R caught a fake request for an agent to be sent here, signed by someone on the Delphinus!""

""But the Del—""

""Yeah. Missing. The request was fake. Now you see why I want to destroy this place. Who’d dare forge that unless they knew the original officer was missing or dead?""

""What are we doing here, Stet?"" Orne asked. ""Alien contact needs a full team with—""

""We’ve got five days before we blast. Unless you clear them first. Bullone will find out about this planet by then. Imagine the chaos. We need this planet cleared or gone before that.""

""I don’t like this, Stet.""

""You don’t like it!""

""Look, there must be another way. When we teamed up with the Alerinoids, we gained so much knowledge.""

""The Alerinoids didn’t attack our survey ship first.""

""What if the Delphinus just crashed and the locals found it?""

""That’s what you’re going to find out. But answer this: If they have the Delphinus, how long before they’re a threat to the galaxy?""

""I saw their city, Stet. They could be ready in six months.""

""Yeah.""

""But think of it: Two different civilizations! Imagine the possibilities.""

""You sound like a Uni-Galacta lecture! Are you done dreaming?""

Orne took a deep breath. ""Why me?""

""You’d still be listed as an R&R field man. Important for your cover.""

""Am I the only one? I know I’m new, but—""

""You want out?""

""I didn’t say that. I just want to know why—""

""They fed your details into a computer. It picked you: capable, dependable ... and expendable!""

""Hey!""

""That’s why I’m here briefing you. I got you into I-A. Listen: If you call for help without reason, I’ll personally make your life miserable. But if you’re in trouble, I’ll dive this cruiser into that city to save you!""

Orne swallowed. ""Thanks, Stet.""

""We’ll orbit above. Beyond us are five transports of I-A marines and a Class IX Monitor with a planet-buster. You’re in charge. First, find out if they have the Delphinus and where it is. Then, see how dangerous these creatures are. Can we control them?""

""In five days?""

""Not a second more.""

""What do we know about them?""

""Not much. They look like old Earth chimpanzees with blue fur. No hair on their faces, pink skin.""

Stetson turned on a screen showing a creature. ""Like that. It’s life-size.""

""Looks like the missing link,"" Orne said.

""Vertical-slit pupils,"" he noticed. The creature was about five feet tall with a slightly hunched stance, long arms, and four fingers. It wore a belt with pouches and tools. There seemed to be a tail tip behind one leg. Its city rose behind it, tall and spire-like.

""Tails?"" Orne asked.

""Yeah. They live in trees. No roads, just vine paths through jungles.""

""A city that advanced?"" Orne asked.

""Maybe a slave culture.""

""How many cities?""

""Two. This one and a ruined one on the other side.""

""A ruin? Why?""

""You tell us. Lots of mysteries.""

""What’s the planet like?""

""Mostly jungle. Some polar oceans, lakes, and rivers. One low mountain chain near the equator.""

""But only two cities. Sure?""

""We’d see something as big as this one. It’s huge, fifty kilometers long, ten wide, full of these creatures. Population over thirty million.""

""Wow! Tall buildings, too.""

""We don’t know much, Orne. Unless you bring them in, there’ll only be ruins for archaeologists.""

""Seems a waste.""

""I agree, but—""

The bell rang.

""Yeah, Hal?"" Stetson sounded tired.

""Mob’s five kilometers out. Orne’s gear is in the disguised sled outside.""

""We’ll be right down.""

""Why a disguised sled?"" Orne asked.

""They might get careless, thinking it’s a ground buggy. We could always scoop you out of the air.""

""What are my chances, Stet?""

Stetson shrugged. ""Slim. They probably have the Delphinus and want you for info and equipment.""

""That bad?""

""Best guess. If you’re not out in five days, we blast.""

Orne cleared his throat.

""Want out?"" Stetson asked.

""No.""

""Use the back-door rule: always leave a way out. Now, let’s check that equipment in your neck."" Stetson touched his throat. Without speaking, a voice hissed in Orne’s ears: ""You read me?""

""Sure. I can—""

""No!"" the voice hissed. ""Touch the contact. Use your speaking muscles without speaking.""

Orne did.

""Okay,"" Stetson said. ""You’re clear.""

""I’d better be. I’m right here!""

""There’ll be a ship relaying everything. We’ll monitor all. Got it?""

""Yes.""

Stetson held out his hand. ""Good luck. I meant it about diving in for you. Just say the word.""

""I know the word, too,"" Orne said. ""HELP!""

---

The jungle was dark and muddy with huge bluish trees. The sled, disguised and with its gravity units off, bumped and slid around tree roots. Headlights swung in wild arcs, and creepers hung from the forest ceiling. Condensation dripped, forcing Orne to use wipers.

Orne felt queasy due to the planet’s lighter gravity.

Creatures flitted through the air. Insects flew towards the lights. Strange sounds filled the jungle.

Stetson’s voice hissed: “How’s it look?”

“Alien.”

“Any sign of that mob?”

“Negative.”

“Okay. We’re taking off.”

The scout cruiser roared and lifted, leaving silence behind.

Suddenly, something swung through the headlights and landed on the sled’s hood.

Orne stopped. A Gienahn crouched on the hood, pointing a Mark XX rifle at Orne’s head. Orne recognized it as a marine guard weapon from the Delphinus.

The native looked like the one on the screen, with four capable fingers holding the rifle.

Orne pressed his throat contact and moved his speaking muscles: “Just made contact. One on the hood has a Mark XX rifle aimed at me.”

Stetson’s voice hissed in his ears: “Want us to come back?”

“Negative. Stand by. He looks cautious, not hostile.”

Orne raised his hands, palm out, then lifted both hands. Universal sign of peace: empty hands. The rifle lowered a bit. Orne remembered the greeting phrase.

“Ffroiragrazzi,” he said.

The native shifted, answered in perfect High Galactese: “Who are you?”

Orne felt a jolt of panic. The lips looked strange forming familiar words.

Stetson’s voice hissed: “Is that the native speaking Galactese?”

Orne touched his throat. “You heard him.”

Orne spoke. “I am Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and Reeducation. I was sent here at the request of the First-Contact officer on the Delphinus.”

“Where is your ship?” asked the Gienahn.

“It put me down and left,” said Orne.

“Why?”

“It was behind schedule for another appointment.”

Orne saw more shadows dropping around him. Someone climbed onto the sled’s load.

The native opened the cab door, rifle ready. “What do you carry in this vehicle?”

“The equipment every R&R field man uses to help rediscovered planets improve.”

Orne nodded at the rifle. “Would you mind pointing that somewhere else? It makes me nervous.”

The gun stayed on Orne. The native showed long canines. “Do we not look strange to you?”

“I take it there’s been a big mutation on this planet,” Orne said. “What caused it? Radiation?”

No answer.

“It doesn’t really matter,” Orne said. “I’m here to help.”

“I am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,” said the native. “I decide who helps.”

Orne swallowed.

“Where do you go?” asked Tanub.

“I was hoping to visit your city. Is it allowed?”

Tanub’s eyes expanded and contracted. “It is allowed.”

Stetson’s voice came through: “All bets off. We’re coming in. That Mark XX rifle confirms they have the Delphinus!”

Orne touched his throat. “No! Give me more time!”

“Why?”

“I have a hunch about these creatures.”

“What is it?”

“No time now. Trust me.”

Another pause while Orne and Tanub studied each other. Stetson said: “Okay. Go ahead. But find the Delphinus! If we get it back, we can deal with them.”

“Why do you keep touching your throat?” Tanub asked.

“I’m nervous,” Orne said. “Guns make me nervous.”

The rifle lowered slightly.

“Shall we go to your city?” asked Orne. He licked his lips. The cab light gave Tanub an eerie look.

“We can go soon,” Tanub said. “After Chiranachuruso rises.”

“Chiranachuruso?”

“Our moon,” said Tanub.

“It’s a beautiful word,” said Orne. “Chiranachuruso.”

“It means: The Limb of Victory,” said Tanub. “By its light, we will go.”

Orne turned to look at Tanub. “You mean you can see by the moonlight through the trees?”

“Can’t you see?” Tanub asked.

“Not without headlights.”

“Our eyes differ,” said Tanub. He peered at Orne. “You are the same as the others.”

“Oh, on the Delphinus?”

Pause. “Yes.”

The jungle grew darker. The wild life quieted. There was a commotion from the natives around the sled. Tanub shifted.

“We may go now,” he said. “Slowly ... behind my scouts.”

“Right.” Orne eased the sled forward, avoiding a root.

Silence as they moved. Shapes swung from vine to vine.

“I admired your city from the air,” Orne said. “It’s beautiful.”

“Yes,” said Tanub. “Why did you land so far away?”

“We didn’t want to destroy anything.”

“There’s nothing to destroy in the jungle,” said Tanub.

“Why do you have such a big city?” asked Orne.

Silence.

“I said: Why do you—”

“You are ignorant of our ways,” Tanub said. “So, I forgive you. The city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight. Once, we used crude platforms on the trees. Now, only the wild ones do this.”

Stetson’s voice hissed: “Careful about sex talk. That’s touchy. These creatures lay eggs. Sex glands are hidden in the fur behind their chins.”

“Who controls the breeding sites controls our world,” said Tanub. “Once there was another city. We destroyed it.”

“Are there many wild ones?” asked Orne.

“Fewer each year,” said Tanub.

“That’s how they get slaves,” hissed Stetson.

“You speak excellent Galactese,” Orne said.

“The High Path Chief ordered the best teacher,” said Tanub. “Do you know many things, Orne?”

“That’s why I’m here,” said Orne.

“Are there many planets to teach?” asked Tanub.

“Very many,” said Orne. “Your city—I saw very tall buildings. What are they made of?”

“In your language—glass,” said Tanub. “The Delphinus engineers said it was impossible. They were wrong.”

“A glass-blowing culture,” hissed Stetson. “That explains a lot.”

The disguised sled crept through the jungle. A scout swooped into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped. They waited ten minutes before moving on.

“Wild ones?” Orne asked.

“Maybe,” said Tanub.

Glowing lights appeared through the trees. They grew brighter as they reached the city’s edge.

Orne looked up in awe. The city towered into the moonlit sky, a delicate web of bridges, lights glittering like dew.

“All that with glass,” murmured Orne.

“What’s happening?” Stetson hissed.

Orne touched his throat. “We’re just entering the city, heading toward a building.”

“This is far enough,” said Tanub.

Orne stopped the sled. Armed Gienahns surrounded them. A tall building loomed ahead.

Tanub leaned close. “We haven’t tricked you, have we, Orne?”

“Huh? What do you mean?”

“You know we aren’t mutated members of your race.”

Orne swallowed. Stetson’s voice said: “Better admit it.”

“That’s true,” said Orne.

“I like you, Orne,” said Tanub. “You’ll be my slave. You’ll teach me many things.”

“How did you capture the Delphinus?” Orne asked.

“You know that, too?”

“You have one of their rifles,” said Orne.

“Your race is no match for us, Orne, in cunning or strength. Your ship landed to fix its tubes. Very poor ceramics in those tubes.”

Orne looked at Tanub. “Have you heard about the I-A, Tanub?”

“I-A? What’s that?” Tanub’s mouth showed long canines.

“You took the Delphinus by trickery?” Orne asked.

“They were simple fools,” said Tanub. “We are smaller, so they thought us weak.” The rifle pointed at Orne’s stomach. “You haven’t answered. What’s the I-A?”

“I’m I-A,” said Orne. “Where’s the Delphinus?”

“In the best place for us,” said Tanub. “In all our history, the best place.”

“What do you plan to do with it?” Orne asked.

“Within a year, we’ll have a copy with our improvements. After that—”

“You plan to start a war?” Orne asked.

“In the jungle, the strong kill the weak until only the strong remain,” said Tanub.

“And then the strong prey on each other?” Orne asked.

“That’s a woman’s quibble,” said Tanub.

“It’s too bad you think that way,” said Orne. “When two cultures meet, they help each other. What happened to the Delphinus crew?”

“They’re slaves,” said Tanub. “Those who still live. Some resisted. Others refused to teach us.” He waved the gun. “You won’t be foolish, will you, Orne?”

“No need to be,” said Orne. “I’ve another lesson: I know where the Delphinus is.”

“Go, boy!” hissed Stetson. “Where is it?”

“Impossible!” barked Tanub.

“It’s on your moon,” said Orne. “Darkside. On a mountain on the darkside.”

Tanub’s eyes widened. “You read minds?”

“The I-A doesn’t need to read minds,” said Orne. “We rely on mental prowess.”

“The marines are on their way,” hissed Stetson. “We’re coming to get you. I want to know how you guessed that.”

“You’re a weak fool like the others,” Tanub gritted.

“It’s too bad you judged us by R&R’s low grades,” said Orne.

“Easy, boy,” hissed Stetson. “Don’t fight him. Remember, he’s as strong as an ape.”

“I could kill you now!” Tanub threatened.

“You’d doom your planet if you do,” said Orne. “I’m not alone. Others hear every word. A ship overhead could split your planet, wash it with molten rock. It’d flow like the glass you use.”

“You’re lying!”

“We’ll make you an offer,” said Orne. “We don’t want to destroy you. We’ll give you limited membership in the Galactic Federation until you prove you’re no threat.”

“Keep talking,” hissed Stetson. “Keep him interested.”

“You insult me!” growled Tanub.

“You’d better believe me,” said Orne. “We—”

Stetson interrupted: “Got it, Orne! They found the Delphinus on the ground where you said! Marines mopping up.”

“It’s like this,” said Orne. “We’ve recaptured the Delphinus.” Tanub looked skyward. “Except for the captured weapons you hold, you obviously lack the means to fight us,” Orne continued. “You wouldn’t carry a Delphinus rifle otherwise.”

“If you’re truthful, we’ll die bravely,” said Tanub.

“No need to die,” said Orne.

“Better to die than be slaves,” said Tanub.

“We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We—”

“I can’t risk you’re lying,” said Tanub. “I must kill you now.”

Orne’s foot rested on the sled’s control pedal. He pressed it. The sled shot skyward, G’s pressing them into seats. The gun in Tanub’s hands slammed into his lap. Orne took it, found safety belts, and tied Tanub.

“We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We have machines. We’ll send experts to teach you to use your planet, build transport, mine minerals.”

“What do we do in return?” whispered Tanub.

“Teach us how to make superior glass,” Orne said. “I hope you see things our way. We don’t want to blast your city into pieces.”

Tanub sagged. “Send me back. I’ll discuss this with our council.” He stared at Orne. “You I-A’s are too strong. We didn’t know.”

---

In the scout cruiser’s wardroom, the lights were low, chairs comfortable, the table set with brandy and glasses.

Orne sipped from his glass. “For a while, I thought I’d never taste this again.”

“ComGO heard everything,” Stetson said. “You’ve been promoted to senior field man.”

“They’ve recognized my worth,” Orne said with a grin.

Stetson grinned back. “Senior field men don’t last long. Mortality’s high.”

“I might’ve guessed,” Orne said, sipping again.

Stetson turned on a recorder. “Okay, go ahead.”

“Where should I start?”

“First, how’d you guess where the Delphinus was?”

“Easy. Tanub’s word for his people was Grazzi. Most races call themselves something meaning The People. But in his tongue, that’s Ocheero. Grazzi wasn’t on the translated list. A likely guess was it meant enemy.”

“And that told you where the Delphinus was?”

“No. But it fit my hunch about these Gienahns. I felt they were like ancient Earth Indians.”

“Why?”

“They came in like a raiding party. The leader dropped onto my sled, a brave act. Counting coup, see?”

“I guess.”

“Then he said he was High Path Chief. Not on the language list, but easy: Raider Chief. Almost every language has a word for raider from road, path, or highway.”

“Highwaymen.”

“Raid. Old Earth language corruption of road.”

“Yeah, yeah. But how’d this translation stuff—”

“Don’t rush. Glass-blowing meant they were just out of primitive. We could control that. Then he said their moon was Chiranachuruso: The Limb of Victory. It fit.”

“How?”

“Vertical-slit pupils mean anything?”

“Maybe. What’s it mean to you?”

“Night predator, dropping on prey. No other type has that slit. Tanub said the Delphinus was hidden in the best place in their history. History? A high place. Dark, too. So: a high place on their moon’s darkside.”

“I’m a pie-eyed greepus,” Stetson whispered.

Orne grinned. “You probably are ... sir.”

Illustrated by Karl Rogers

No self-respecting artist can object to suffering for his art... but not in a society where art is outdated by technology!

**I**

Halvorsen was waiting in the Chancery office. He was feeling dizzy because he was so hungry. The secretary finally motioned for him to go in. He almost forgot his art portfolio as he left his chair and had to go back for it, feeling embarrassed.

Inside, Monsignor Reedy had bad news. ""I've brought the designs for the Stations, Padre,"" Halvorsen said, opening his portfolio. But the monsignor explained that the church could save money by using machines instead of hiring artists like Halvorsen. The artist, frustrated, argued, ""S.P.G.--slimy imitations. No texture. No guts."" But the monsignor said they needed to save money for schools and charities.

Halvorsen left the office, feeling heavy-hearted. He hoped Monsignor Reedy would send him some money, pretending it was for expenses, as he had in the past.

Walking down the street, Halvorsen knew there wouldn't be any more advances. Machines were replacing sculptors like him, even in the church.

He passed an S.P.G. salon, where one of his students worked. He went inside, feeling disgusted by the plastic statues. He asked his student, Lewis, for an advance on his next month’s tuition. Lewis showed him how the machines worked, explaining how they used special computers to make statues quickly and cheaply.

Halvorsen left with ten dollars and went to a cheap restaurant. There, he looked through the help-wanted ads in the paper. All the jobs were for machine operators, not artists. He felt panicked.

---

**II**

Halvorsen took the subway home to his studio, where he taught art classes and worked. A girl had come in to inquire about classes. Trying to be friendly, Halvorsen told her about the drawing and painting classes he offered.

The girl seemed interested, but she was shocked at the prices of his artwork. She told him that machine-made sculptures were much cheaper.

Suddenly, Halvorsen fainted.

When he woke up, he was in his bed, and a doctor was there. The doctor said he was malnourished and needed vitamins and food. The girl, who introduced herself as Lucretia, had bought groceries for him. She signed up for his classes and left, taking with her a small bronze statue Halvorsen insisted she keep as a thank you.

---

**III**

Lucretia returned for her art class on Tuesday, along with other students. After class, she introduced Halvorsen to her friend Austin Malone, who was interested in buying some of Halvorsen’s work. Malone bought a terra-cotta piece, but made harsh comments about how Halvorsen worked by hand in a world run by machines.

Halvorsen felt conflicted. He knew that Lucretia liked him, but he feared getting involved in a relationship that would distract him from his work.

---

**IV**

Halvorsen went to trade some lumber with old Mr. Krehbeil, a carpenter. Halvorsen needed wood to crate the piece he sold to Malone. Mr. Krehbeil was still trying to make things by hand, but he didn’t have much work anymore. Everyone wanted things made by machines. Halvorsen felt a connection to the old man, as they both struggled to keep their crafts alive.

When Halvorsen returned to his studio, Lucretia was there again. She had brought him more groceries. But Halvorsen was harsh with her, pushing her away because he was afraid of the emotions she stirred in him.

---

**V**

Feeling lost and desperate, Halvorsen went to Europe, planning to end his life in the ruins of Copenhagen. There, he found the Orpheus Fountain, a beautiful sculpture that moved him deeply. As he collapsed from exhaustion and radiation poisoning, he felt he heard music from the fountain.

---

**VI**

Halvorsen woke up in a hidden valley in Europe, where people had saved him. They were untouched by the wars and radiation that had destroyed so much of the continent. An old man explained that they needed someone like Halvorsen to teach them art and to create things of beauty.

The old man offered him a new start, a place where he could work and live among people who valued his skills. Halvorsen realized he had found a home and a new purpose.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in ""With These Hands"" by C. M. Kornbluth revolves around the struggle between traditional artistry and the encroachment of technology on creative professions. Halvorsen, the protagonist, is a sculptor who finds his skills and livelihood threatened by machines that can mass-produce art quickly and cheaply. This conflict is exacerbated by the societal shift towards valuing efficiency and cost-effectiveness over the unique, tactile quality of handmade art.

Halvorsen's personal dilemma is twofold: his professional identity is at risk as his craft becomes obsolete, and he faces a personal struggle with his own sense of worth in a world that seems to have moved on from what he values most. Additionally, his interactions with Lucretia introduce a conflict between pursuing personal relationships and dedicating himself entirely to his art.

Ultimately, the story resolves this conflict by offering Halvorsen a new beginning in a place where his skills are not only appreciated but needed, allowing him to reconcile his passion for art with a community that values his contributions. This resolution suggests a hopeful perspective on the coexistence of tradition and innovation.","Imagine your life's work can be done by a machine. Do you give up, or fight back?","Could you watch a machine take over your dreams, or would you stand up for what you believe in?","If a machine could do your job better and faster, how would you show the world what it's missing?"

**How to Tell a Story**  

There are different kinds of stories, but the funny ones are the hardest to tell. Funny stories are an American thing, while comic stories are English, and witty stories are French. A funny story is all about how you tell it, while comic and witty stories depend on what you say.

A funny story can be long and take its time, but comic and witty stories need to be short and have a punchline. The funny story just flows along, but the others have a big ending.

Telling a funny story is an art, and only some people can do it well. You have to tell it seriously, like you don't even know it's funny. But when telling a comic story, the teller laughs first and repeats the funny part for applause. 

A good example of the comic style is ""The Wounded Soldier."" In it, a soldier loses his leg in battle and asks another soldier to carry him back. But then a cannonball takes off his head instead. The soldier carrying him doesn't notice and keeps going. An officer asks where he's going with the body, and the soldier says he's taking him to the back because he lost his leg. The officer points out it's his head that's gone. The soldier then says, ""But he TOLD me it was his leg—"" 

Telling the story in a comic way is quick, but in a funny way, like James Whitcomb Riley tells it, it takes longer and is much funnier. Riley tells it as if he's a farmer who just heard the story and tries to repeat it but keeps messing it up. The farmer laughs a lot and can't get through the story without stopping to laugh, and by the end, everyone is laughing too.

The funny story is about being innocent and not knowing it's funny. It's an art to make people laugh without trying hard, and only a master can do it.

**The Golden Arm**

Once upon a time, there was a mean man who lived far away with his wife. She had a golden arm, and when she died, he buried her. But he wanted that arm so bad that at midnight, he went back and dug it up. As he was walking home with the arm, he heard the wind say, ""Who got my golden arm?"" He got scared and ran home, but the voice followed him, saying, ""Who got my golden arm?"" When he got into bed, the voice got closer and closer until it was right by him and said, ""Who got my golden arm?"" Then you yell, ""You've got it!"" and scare someone listening.

**Mental Telegraphy Again**

Mark Twain talks about strange things that seem like mind-reading. Once, he thought he saw an old friend at a party, but she wasn't there. Later, he saw her and told her about it. She was surprised since she had just thought about him.

Another time, Twain thought about a trip to Australia, and right after, he got a letter from a man there offering him a tour. He thinks maybe the letter passing through the mail made him think of the trip.

**The Invalid's Story**

A man tells how he got sick. He was healthy until he took a train ride with what he thought was his friend's coffin. But it was really a box of guns, and there was some very smelly cheese on it. The smell made him and the expressman, Thompson, think it was the body. They tried to cover the smell with cigars and carbolic acid, but nothing worked. They had to go outside because the smell was too strong. The man got very sick afterward and never got better, thinking it was the smell that did it.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict or dilemma in Mark Twain's ""How to Tell a Story and Others"" revolves around the art and challenge of storytelling, particularly in distinguishing and effectively delivering different types of humorous stories. Twain explores the nuances between funny stories, which rely heavily on the manner of telling, and comic and witty stories, which depend more on content and timing.

1. **How to Tell a Story**: The conflict here is about mastering the art of telling a funny story, which Twain argues is more challenging than telling a comic or witty story. The dilemma is in delivering the story in a way that seems earnest and unaware of its humor, a skill that only a few can execute well.

2. **The Wounded Soldier**: The conflict in this anecdote lies in the soldier's misunderstanding, which leads to a humorous situation. The dilemma is between the comic and funny styles of storytelling, as Twain illustrates how the same story can be told in different ways for varying comedic effect.

3. **The Golden Arm**: The conflict here is a classic ghost story dilemma, where the protagonist faces fear and guilt after committing an act of greed. The twist at the end relies on the storyteller's ability to surprise and scare the audience.

4. **Mental Telegraphy Again**: The conflict in this essay is the mysterious and seemingly inexplicable nature of mental telepathy or coincidences. The dilemma is whether these occurrences are simply chance or indicative of some deeper connection or communication.

5. **The Invalid's Story**: The central conflict revolves around the misunderstanding and mistaken identity of the smelly cheese for a decaying body. The dilemma is the narrator's struggle with the overpowering smell and its impact on his health, leading to a comedic yet tragic outcome.

Overall, Twain's work examines the intricacies of storytelling, the fine line between different types of humor, and the misunderstandings that can lead to both comedic and serious consequences.",Would you dig up a grave for treasure if you knew a ghost would follow you home?

008.txt,"This is how it all began—the big fight that changed our world!

A little old lady was crossing the street when she noticed a big black car coming straight at her. Inside the car, there were seven people who looked blurry, like they were underwater. The lady realized she couldn’t make it to the sidewalk in time. The car kept coming, and people watching from the sidewalk gasped in horror.

The old lady reached into her shopping bag and pulled out a big blue-black gun. She held it tight and shot at the car’s windshield three times before the car hit her.

From the sidewalk, a young woman in a wheelchair shouted angrily at the car. The driver of the car, Smythe-de Winter, was upset because the old lady's last shot had hurt two people in the car. The bullet broke through the glass and hit one person in the neck and another in the head.

Smythe-de Winter stopped the car suddenly and drove onto the sidewalk. People jumped out of the way, but he hit the girl in the wheelchair. Then he drove away, feeling mad and sad because the world around him seemed to be falling apart.

While his friends cleaned up and sang softly for their lost friends, Smythe-de Winter muttered, ""Old ladies shouldn’t have guns."" His friend agreed and said, ""I hate people on foot. Cars forever!""

The incident caused an uproar in the city. At a memorial for the old lady and the girl in the wheelchair, a speaker criticized the car drivers and talked about a time when pedestrians were safe. He encouraged people to protest against the drivers.

Meanwhile, at a service for the people from the car, another speaker reminded everyone of the strict rules from the past when pedestrians couldn’t carry weapons. He hinted that something big needed to happen to fix the city.

Groups of kids ran into the suburbs, slashing tires and causing trouble, while young people from the suburbs rode motorcycles into the slums, scaring people and causing chaos.

The government quickly stopped all traffic between the city and the suburbs and made a rule for everyone to stay inside in the slums. Government agents moved around to show they weren’t on anyone’s side.

People spent the day getting ready for more trouble. In the suburbs, they prepared their cars with weapons. In the slums, people got ready with guns and prepared traps for cars. They even had two big guns ready to use.

At night, leaders from both sides met to discuss peace. They talked about what happened and decided on new rules. Pedestrians could only have smaller guns, and drivers had to honk three times before hitting someone in a crosswalk. Blind people were allowed to carry small bombs.

The government spread the news about the new rules. Police and social workers went through the slums, taking away big weapons and calming people down. In the suburbs, they took illegal weapons from cars.

In the morning, everything went back to normal. Smythe-de Winter drove his car through the slums. A brick bounced off his car, and bullets hit the windows, but he just smiled. 

He said to his friend, ""I like a world where things are mostly normal—some success, but not too exciting; some failure, but just enough to keep you alert.""

His friend looked at the street and said, ""That’s where you hit the old lady."" Smythe-de Winter remembered her wild eyes and thought that today felt very boring.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story revolves around the tension between pedestrians and drivers, which escalates into a broader societal clash with far-reaching consequences. This conflict is sparked by a tragic incident where an old lady, in an act of self-defense, shoots at a car that is about to hit her, leading to injuries and deaths on both sides. This event highlights the underlying issues of safety, weaponization, and the division between different societal groups.

The story captures how this single incident acts as a catalyst for a larger conflict between those who travel on foot and those who prefer vehicles, leading to chaos and violence in the city and suburbs. The conflict is further intensified by deep-seated resentments and differing views on safety and personal freedoms.

Ultimately, the narrative explores themes of power, control, and the struggle for coexistence in a world where different factions have their own interests and grievances.

009.txt,"Title: The Drug

Amos Parry worked for a company called Whelan, Inc., which made farm chemicals and feeds. One day, Amos arrived at work early and found Frank Barnes, the head chemist, looking worried. Amos tried to cheer him up before saying, ""Frank, the sales team is pushing for that new hormone product.""

Frank looked even more anxious. ""Bill Detrick called about it yesterday, Mr. Parry. I'm sorry if I was rude to him.""

Amos smiled. ""If you were, he didn't mention it. But we need to speed things up. Buffalo will be on our backs soon. How many people are working on it?""

""Just two, helping with routine work. I've done most of it myself, evenings and weekends. I didn't want too many people knowing about it. Mr. Parry, I'm worried.""

""Worried? Why?""

""Let me show you the pigs we've been testing it on.""

They went outside to see the pigs. Amos noticed they looked odd for their age. ""How old is that boar pig?""

""Not quite four months.""

Amos thought it looked older and different from normal pigs. ""Is it just about their health?""

""I don't think so, Mr. Parry. This isn't actually a hormone.""

Amos was surprised. ""Then what is it?""

""It's a drug that causes strong hallucinations. It's related to mescaline.""

Amos joked, ""Pipe dreams for pigs?""

He stopped joking when he realized the implications. If the drug failed, they'd be in trouble. But if it worked and they sold it, what would it do to humans?

Frank showed Amos another pig that looked even stranger. Its hair was thicker and black, and it moved oddly. Amos felt uncomfortable. ""What's wrong with it?""

""It's healthy, but it looks and acts differently.""

They were looking at the pig when it stood up on its hind legs and squealed for attention. Amos patted it, and the squealing stopped. He realized the pig was imitating the cat. ""Has the cat been around a lot?""

Frank looked at the cat, then back at the pig, looking worried.

Later, Amos had a busy day at work. His sales manager, Bill Detrick, was pushing to release the new hormone quickly. Amos knew it would take at least a year for proper testing and approval. He felt pressured from all sides.

At home, his wife was upset about their son getting into trouble and other family matters. Amos felt stressed and turned to the bar for a drink.

The next morning, the company president called from Buffalo, asking about the new hormone. Amos knew they wanted it to be ready soon, but he was worried about the consequences.

Frank Barnes came to see Amos and resigned, saying he had taken some of the drug himself. He explained that the drug awakened parts of the mind and body that were usually asleep. Amos was skeptical but curious.

After Frank left, Amos decided to try the drug himself. He felt his mind racing with thoughts and ideas. He realized he could understand his body better and even control it in new ways.

Later, Amos learned that Frank had died. But then he discovered that Frank had transferred his mind into a cat. Frank explained how he did it and said he wanted to stay around and watch things.

Amos considered doing the same. He thought about the responsibility of releasing the drug to the world. He decided to wait because he didn't want people like Detrick to misuse it.

In the end, Amos and Alice, who also took the drug, lived as pigeons, free from the pressures of the human world. They decided to move on to a new place, leaving the stressful life behind.",What is the central conflict / dillema in the story?,"The central conflict in the story ""The Drug"" revolves around the ethical and professional dilemma faced by Amos Parry regarding the development and potential release of a new drug by Whelan, Inc. Initially believed to be a hormone for farm animals, the drug turns out to be a powerful hallucinogen with the ability to significantly alter consciousness and physical attributes. This discovery places Amos in a precarious position, as he must navigate pressures from his company to release the product quickly, while grappling with the moral implications of its potential effects on humans and animals.

Amos is caught between the commercial interests of his company, represented by the sales team and executives eager to launch the product, and the ethical considerations highlighted by Frank Barnes, the head chemist, who is deeply concerned about the drug's true nature and consequences. The conflict intensifies as Amos experiences the drug's transformative effects himself, which leads him to a deeper understanding of its power and potential misuse.

Ultimately, the story explores themes of responsibility, the pursuit of knowledge, and the temptation to escape from societal pressures. Amos's final decision to live as a pigeon with Alice signifies a choice to reject the corporate and ethical dilemmas of the human world, opting instead for a simpler, liberated existence.
